# Adam

## Adam was 60 cubits tall

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their form would be alike as one single person after the form of their father (Adam) sixty cubits tall.

1 Arabic cubit was traditionally 64 cm long, which means Adam would be 38.4 meters tall.



# Allah

## Allah prays

Surah 2:157

> Upon those are the prayers *from* their Lord, and mercy; and those are they (who) are the right-guided.

[Quran 33:43, 56 Palmer](https://sacred-texts.com/isl/sbe09/033.htm)

> He it is who prays for you and His angels too, to bring you forth out of the darkness into the light, for He is merciful to the believers. …  Verily, God and His angels pray for the prophet. O ye who believe! pray for him and salute him with a salutation!

[Al Adan Al Mufrad 645](https://sunnah.com/adab:645)

> [Muhammad] said, "If anyone prays once on me, Allah will pray ten times on him.'"

Who is Allah praying to?

## Allah is a narcissist 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4634](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4634)

> And none loves to be praised more than Allah does, and for this reason He praises Himself.

## Allah wonders 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3010](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3010)

> The Prophet said, "Allah wonders at those people who will enter Paradise in chains."

Apparently there are things that surprise Allah. How could someone supposedly all-knowing wonder about anything?

## Allah is limited to one location

Surah 20:5

> the Most Compassionate, Who is˺ established on the Throne.

Allah sits on a throne in heaven.

## Allah comes down every night

[Sahih Muslim 758b](https://sunnah.com/muslim:758b)

> Allah descends every night to the lowest heaven when one-third of the first part of the night is over (3 am) and says: I am the Lord; I am the Lord: who is there to supplicate Me so that I answer him? Who is there to beg of Me so that I grant him? Who is there to beg forgiveness from Me so that I forgive him? He continues like this till the day breaks.

Allah doesn't know how time zones work. If he comes down every night at  3am, and leave at daybreak, in what time zone is he? It would mean that in one time zone he is descending while in another time zone he is ascending, at the same time. Therefore Allah is always somewhere in our atmosphere at all times, yet he is unable to enter our world, and he is [also located on his throne?](#allah-is-limited-to-one-location) How does it work?

## Allah shakes hands

[Sunan Ibn Majah 104](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:104)

> The Messenger of Allah said: 'The first person with whom Allah will shake hands will be 'Umar...

This means Allah has physical hands the size of human hands with which he can shake hands with humans. How embarrassing for Muhammad himself that someone else gets to shake hands with Allah before him.

## Allah deceives

Surah 8:43-44

> Recall: Allah showing them to you in your sleep as few, for had He showed them to you as many, you would have faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter, but Allah saved (the situation). He is indeed All-Knowing of what lies within the chests. And recall: when you met, Him showing them to you as few in your eyes and making you appear fewer in their eyes, so that Allah might carry out a predetermined matter. And to Allah all matters are returned.

Allah deceived Muhammad to go into battle against a large army, making him think it was a small army. He also deceived his enemies in the same way.

Surah 4:157

> and their saying, “We have surely killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah. ”In fact, they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them as if they had. And indeed, those who differed over him are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it—just following assumptions. And certainly, they did not kill him.

Allah deceived the Jews and Romans into thinking they killed Jesus. Allah is deceptive.

This is also a verse that proves Islam is historically false, for [the crucifixion of Jesus is the most well documented event in ancient history.](#no-crucifixion)

## Allah wants people to sin

[Sahih Muslim 2749](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2749)

> By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if you were not to commit sin, Allah would sweep you out of existence and He would replace (you by) those people who would commit sin and seek forgiveness from Allah, and He would have pardoned them.

## Allah wants contention

> Yet if Allah had willed, they would not have fought one another. But Allah does what He wills.

Disagreements and fights between religious factions is Allah's will. He wants people to be divided and fighting.

## Allah blinds people to the truth

Surah 2:7

> Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and over their sight is a veil; for for them is a great punishment.

It is Allah's fault if someone does not believe.

## Allah needs your money

Surah 2:254

> Donate from what We have provided for you before the arrival of a Day when there will be no bargaining, friendship, or intercession. 

Give him your money before it's too late!

## Allah has predestined adultery

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6612](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6612)

> Allah has written for the son of Adam his inevitable share of adultery whether he is aware of it or not

[Sahih Muslim 2657 b](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2657b)

> Allah has fixed the very portion of adultery which a man will indulge in, and which he of necessity must commit.

## Allah pampers Muhammad

[Sahih al Bukhari 4788](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4788)

> I said (to the Prophet), "I feel that your Lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires."

Even Aisha noticed that the "revelations" that Muhammad got from Allah was suspiciously self-serving, affording him all sorts of luxuries and privileges. For example he was the only one who could take more than 4 wives, he could use his female slaves as sex slaves without his wives being able to complain, could steal his adoptive son's wife, and Allah even instructed people how to handle dinner parties at his place, because Muhammad was too shy to tell people himself. It seems like every time Muhammad had any desire, Allah came with a convenient revelation permitting him to go ahead.





# Animals

## Owning a dog gives you minus points {#owning-a-dog}

[Sahih al Bukhari 5480](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5480)

> "Whoever keeps a (pet) dog which is neither a watch dog nor a hunting dog, will get a daily deduction of two Qirat from his good deeds."






# Apostasy 

## Punishment for apostasy is being stoned to death {#apostasy-death-sentence}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2535](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2535)

> “Whoever changes his religion, execute him.”

- [Sunan Ibn Majah 2533](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2533)
- [Sunan Ibn Majah 2534](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2534)











# Contradictions

## Contradicting the Bible

### Who named the animals?

Surah 2:31

> He taught Adam the names of all things, 

In the Bible it is Adam who had the task of naming all animals.

### The affliction in Egypt

Surah 2:48

> the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with dreadful torment, slaughtering your sons and keeping your women. That was a severe test from your Lord

According to the Bible, slavery in Egypt was not a trial from God but an affliction from the Egyptians. 

### Seeing God

Surah 2:55

> And ˹remember˺ when you said, “O Moses! We will never believe you until we see Allah with our own eyes,” so a thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on.

There is no such story in the Bible. Rather the Israelites were terrified and did not want to see God.

### How many springs?

Surah 2:60

> We said, “Strike the rock with your staff.” Then twelve springs gushed out

In the Bible there was only one spring.

### Breaking the sabbath

Surah 2: 65,66

> You know about those of you who broke the Sabbath, and so We said to them, ‘Be like apes! Be outcasts!’

God has never said sabbath breakers are apes. Breaking the sabbath was punished by death, not ostracism.

### Raising dead using cow parts

Surah 2:73 

> We said, ‘Strike the [body] with a part of [the cow]’: thus God brings the dead to life and shows His signs so that you may understand.

Israelites are instructed to use parts of a cow carcass to resurrect the dead.

## Contradicting the Quran

Surah 4:82

> Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Had it been from anyone other than Allah, they would have certainly found in it many inconsistencies.

If the Quran is from Allah, there should be no contradictions.


### How long did it take Allah to create the world?

Was it 6 days or 8 days?

Surah 10:3 says Allah created the heavens and the earth in 6 days.

> Surely your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days,...

Surah 41:9-12 says Allah created the heavens and the earth in 8 days. 2 + 4 + 2 = 8. 

> Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “How can you disbelieve in the One Who created the earth in **two Days**? And how can you set up equals with Him? That is the Lord of all worlds. He placed on the earth firm mountains, standing high, showered His blessings upon it, and ordained ˹all˺ its means of sustenance—totaling **four Days** exactly —for all who ask. ... So He formed the heaven into seven heavens in **two Days**, assigning to each its mandate. ... 

### Muhammad did and did not do miracles 

In Surah 6:37; 6:109; 13:7; 17:59; 20:20 it says that Muhammad never did any miracles. But in [Sahih al Bukhari 3637](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3637) it says that he DID do a miracle.

### Are people ransomed from hell or not.

[The Quran says there will be no ransoms whatsoever on judgment day.](#no-ransom) But one Hadith says [muslims will be ransomed from hell by Christians and Jews taking their places in hell.](#ransomed-from-hell).








# Errors 

Historical and factual errors 

## Jews think Ezra is the son of Allah {#ezra-son-of-allah}

Surah 9:30

> The Jews say, “Ezra is the son of Allah,” …

This is false. No Jews have ever claimed that Ezra is the son of God. Is it Allah or Muhammad who is ignorant of this fact?

## Christians worship Mary {#worshipping-mary}

Surah 5:116

> And ˹on Judgment Day˺ Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Did you ever ask the people to worship you and your mother as gods besides Allah?”...

Christians don't worship Mary. But Allah doesn't know this.

## Mary the mother of Jesus is the brother of Aaron {#who-is-mary}

Surah 19:27-28

> Then she returned to her people, carrying him [Jesus]. They said ˹in shock˺, “O Mary! You have certainly done a horrible thing! O  sister of Aaron! Your father was not an indecent man, nor was your mother unchaste.”

Mary the mother of Jesus lived in first century Judaea/Galilee. Mariam the sister of Aaron lived about 1500 years before her in Egypt/Sinai. Allah does not know that these are two different people.

## Pharao ordered Haman to build the Tower of Babel {#pharao-haman-tower}

Surah 40:36

> Pharaoh ordered, “O Hamân! Build me a high tower so I may reach the pathways leading up to the heavens and look for the God of Moses, although I am sure he is a liar.” …

The Pharao was the king of Egypt. Haman was an Amalekite man, an enemy of Israel, who lived in the Persian empire in the 5th century BC, a thousand years later. And the Tower of Babel was built on the plains of Mesopotamia in the 24th century BC, almost a thousand years before. This is the worst imaginable mishmash of stories and characters picked from a time frame of two thousand years.

## Pharao threatened people with crucifixion {#egyptian-crucifixion}

Surah 7:123-124

> Pharaoh threatened, … "I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then crucify you all.”

Crucifixion was never used by ancient Egypt, and did not become a common form of execution by the Romans in the 6th century BC.

See also:

- Surah 20:71
- Surah 25:49

## The Israelites were misled by a Samaritan {#misled-by-samaritan}

Surah 20:85

> Allah responded, “We have indeed tested your people in your absence, and the Samaritan has led them astray.

The Samaritan people did not exist until at least a thousand years after the event where the Israelites were misled into worshipping the golden calf.

## Jesus was not crucified {#no-crucifixion}

Surah 4:157

> and their saying, “We have surely killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah. ”In fact, they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them as if they had. And indeed, those who differed over him are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it—just following assumptions. And certainly, they did not kill him.

That Jesus was crucified by order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate is subject to "almost universal assent" among scholars. Lightfoot Professor of Divinity James Dunn stated that the fact of the baptism and crucifixion of Jesus "rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts, they are obvious starting points for an attempt to clarify the what and why of Jesus' mission." Atheist scholar Bart Ehrman says "Nearly all critical scholars agree at least on those points about the historical Jesus."

In other words, the Quran is historically false.

## No one was named John before John the Baptist

Surah 19:7 

> “O Zachariah! Indeed, We give you the good news of a son, whose name will be John—a name We have not given to anyone before.”

John is not a unique name. in fact it was one of the most popular names in the first century. There are at least 5 people in the New testament named John. The Hebrew equivalent of the name John is "Johanan" and "Jehohanan", which means "Yahweh is gracious." There are at least 17 persons in the old testament with this name, for a total of 22 people in the whole Bible. So Allah and the Quran are wrong that John was the first one with this name.
