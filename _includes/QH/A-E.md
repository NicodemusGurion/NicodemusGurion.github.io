# Adam

## Adam was 60 cubits tall

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://web.archive.org/web/20240310050216/https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their form would be alike as one single person after the form of their father (Adam) sixty cubits tall.

1 Arabic cubit was traditionally 64 cm long, which means Adam would be 38.4 meters tall.



# Allah

## Allah is not a father

Surah 112:4; 18:4; 19:35, 88-93

> He neither begets nor is born,

> It warns those people who assert, ‘God has offspring.’

> it would not befit God to have a child. He is far above that: when He decrees something, He says only, ‘Be,’ and it is.

> The disbelievers say, ‘The Lord of Mercy has offspring.’ How terrible is this thing you assert: it almost causes the heavens to be torn apart, the earth to split asunder, the mountains to crumble to pieces,that they attribute offspring to the Lord of Mercy. It does not befit the Lord of Mercy [to have offspring]: there is no one in the heavens or earth who will not come to the Lord of Mercy as a servant-

You can never have a close relationship with the god of Islam as a child to a father, you can only be a slave to a master. If this is true, then the universe is bleak indeed. 

## Allah has no spouse

Surah 6:101

> the Creator of the heavens and earth! How could He have children when He has no spouse

Muslims believe that the omnipotent one would need to have literal sex with a literal spouse in order to produce offspring. Laughable.

At the same time Surah 39:4 says:

> God could have chosen any of His creation He willed for offspring

So on the one hand Allah could just "choose" a creation as his offspring, but on the other hand he would need a spouse to cproduce offspring. Neither of those are correct, [and they contradict.](#contradictions)

## Allah is not the only creator

Surah 23:14

> So Blessed is Allah, the Best of Creators.

Surah 37:125

> Do you call upon ˹the idol of˺ Ba’l and abandon the Best of Creators—

Allah is only one creator of many. Apparently Ba'l is a competing creator. The other creators are also good, but Allah thinks that he is the best of them.

## Allah is a narcissist 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4634](http://web.archive.org/web/20221005220613/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4634)

> And none loves to be praised more than Allah does, and for this reason He praises Himself.

## Allah deceives

Surah 8:43-44

> Recall: Allah showing them to you in your sleep as few, for had He showed them to you as many, you would have faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter, but Allah saved (the situation). He is indeed All-Knowing of what lies within the chests. And recall: when you met, Him showing them to you as few in your eyes and making you appear fewer in their eyes, so that Allah might carry out a predetermined matter. And to Allah all matters are returned.

Allah deceived Muhammad to go into battle against a large army, making him think it was a small army. He also deceived his enemies in the same way.

Surah 4:157

> and their saying, “We have surely killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah. ”In fact, they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them as if they had. And indeed, those who differed over him are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it—just following assumptions. And certainly, they did not kill him.

Allah deceived the Jews and Romans into thinking they killed Jesus. Allah is deceptive.

This is also a verse that proves Islam is historically false, for [the crucifixion of Jesus is the most well documented event in ancient history.](#no-crucifixion)

Surah 3:54



## Allah blinds people to the truth

Surah 2:7

> Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and over their sight is a veil; for for them is a great punishment.

It is Allah's fault if someone does not believe.

## Allah wants people to sin

[Sahih Muslim 2749](http://web.archive.org/web/20240115142947/https://sunnah.com/muslim:2749)

> By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if you were not to commit sin, Allah would sweep you out of existence and He would replace (you by) those people who would commit sin and seek forgiveness from Allah, and He would have pardoned them.

If people didn't sin, Allah would wipe them out and replace them with people who would sin. 

Who is it that wants people to sin? God, or Satan?

## Allah has predestined adultery

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6612](http://web.archive.org/web/20240208033843/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6612)

> Allah has written for the son of Adam his inevitable share of adultery whether he is aware of it or not

[Sahih Muslim 2657 b](https://web.archive.org/web/20240325212822/https://sunnah.com/muslim:2657b)

> Allah has fixed the very portion of adultery which a man will indulge in, and which he of necessity must commit.

## Allah wants contention

Surah 2:253

> Yet if Allah had willed, they would not have fought one another. But Allah does what He wills.

Disagreements and fights between religious factions is Allah's will. He wants people to be divided and fighting.

## Allah tortures the dead if their relatives grieve

[Sahih al-Bukhari 1286, 1287, 1288](https://web.archive.org/web/20230928004431/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1286)

> Allah increases the punishment of a non-believer because of the weeping of his relatives.

## Allah prays

Surah 2:157

> Upon those are the prayers *from* their Lord, and mercy; and those are they (who) are the right-guided.

[Quran 33:43, 56 Palmer](https://web.archive.org/web/20240509045448/https://sacred-texts.com/isl/sbe09/033.htm)

> He it is who prays for you and His angels too, to bring you forth out of the darkness into the light, for He is merciful to the believers. …  Verily, God and His angels pray for the prophet. O ye who believe! pray for him and salute him with a salutation!

[Al Adan Al Mufrad 645](https://web.archive.org/web/20240318170959/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3010)

> [Muhammad] said, "If anyone prays once on me, Allah will pray ten times on him.'"

Whom is Allah praying to?

## Allah swears by the Lord of the East and West

Surah 70:40

> I swear by the Lord of the easts and the wests that We have the power

Why would Allah swear by someone else? A Lord at that? That only means this Lord is higher than Allah. 

Yahweh in the Bible swear by himself, because there is no one higher. But Allah swears by someone higher.


## Allah is a muslim

Muslims need to take the Shahada, meaning they testify that there is no God but Allah, and that Muhammad is his prophet.

Surah 3:18

> Allah bears witness that there is no god but He.

Surah 48:29

> Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. 

Why does Allah need to take the Shahada to become a Muslim?

## Allah wonders 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3010](https://web.archive.org/web/20240318170959/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3010)

> The Prophet said, "Allah wonders at those people who will enter Paradise in chains."

Apparently there are things that surprise Allah. How could someone supposedly all-knowing wonder about anything?

## Allah can not count

Surah 6:143

> ˹Allah has created˺ four pairs: a pair of sheep and a pair of goats

One pair of sheep and one pair of goats equals four pairs?

## Allah is limited to one location

Surah 20:5

> the Most Compassionate, Who is˺ established on the Throne.

Allah sits on a throne in heaven.

## Allah's throne is upon water {#allah-water-throne}


[Sahih al-Bukhari 7419](https://web.archive.org/web/20221119045204/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7419)

> His Throne is over the water 

See also: 

- [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3045](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3045)
- [The throne of Satan is upon the water](#satan-water-throne)

## Allah's throne can be shaken by human affairs {#shaking-throne}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3803](https://web.archive.org/web/20230916231756/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3803)

> I heard the Prophet saying, "The Throne of Allah shook at the death of Sa`d bin Mu`adh."

- [Sunan Ibn Majah 158](http://web.archive.org/web/20231206105330/https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:158)
- [Sahih Muslim 2466 b](https://web.archive.org/web/20231210111632/https://sunnah.com/muslim:2466b)

## Allah comes down every night

[Sahih Muslim 758b](https://sunnah.com/muslim:758b)

> Allah descends every night to the lowest heaven when one-third of the first part of the night is over (3 am) and says: I am the Lord; I am the Lord: who is there to supplicate Me so that I answer him? Who is there to beg of Me so that I grant him? Who is there to beg forgiveness from Me so that I forgive him? He continues like this till the day breaks.

Allah doesn't know how time zones work. If he comes down every night at  3am, and leave at daybreak, in what time zone is he? It would mean that in one time zone he is descending while in another time zone he is ascending, at the same time. Therefore Allah is always somewhere in our atmosphere at all times, yet he is unable to enter our world, and he is [also located on his throne?](#allah-is-limited-to-one-location) How does it work?

## Allah manifests himself to creation

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 1485](https://sunnah.com/nasai:1485)

> When Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, manifests Himself to anything of His creation, it humbles itself before Him

## Allah is visible 

[Mishkat al-Masabih 725 (Sahih)](https://web.archive.org/web/20231206115420/https://sunnah.com/mishkat:725) 

> I saw my Lord in the most beautiful form…

## Allah has hands

[Mishkat al-Masabih 725 (Sahih)](https://web.archive.org/web/20231206115420/https://sunnah.com/mishkat:725) 

> He placed the palm of His hand between my shoulder-blades and I felt the coolness of it between my nipples!

> I saw my Lord in the most beautiful form…

## Allah shakes hands

[Sunan Ibn Majah 104](https://web.archive.org/web/20230419124702/https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:104)

> The Messenger of Allah said: 'The first person with whom Allah will shake hands will be 'Umar...

This means Allah has physical hands the size of human hands with which he can shake hands with humans. How embarrassing for Muhammad himself that someone else gets to shake hands with Allah before him.

## How many hands does Allah have?

Allah seems to have at least three hands, one left hand and two right hands.

### Allah has a right and left hand

[Sahih Muslim 2788 a](https://web.archive.org/web/20230607232830/https://sunnah.com/muslim:2788a)

> Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, would fold the Heavens on the Day of Judgment and then He would place them on *His right hand* and say: I am the Lord; where are the haughty and where are the proud (today)? He would fold the' earth (placing it) on *the left hand* and say: I am the Lord; where are the haughty and where are the proud (today)?

### Allah also has two right hands

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 5379](https://web.archive.org/web/20221217224642/https://sunnah.com/nasai:5379)

> The Prophet said: "Those who are just and fair will be with Allah, Most High, on thrones of light, at the right hand of the Most Merciful, those who are just in their rulings and in their dealings with their families and those of whom they are in charge." Muhammad said in his Hadith: "And both of His hands are right hands."

## Allah has a face

Surah 55:27

> all that remains is the Face of your Lord

## Allah has eyes

Surah 20:39

> ...you should be reared under My watchful eye

[Sahih Muslim 2933 a](https://web.archive.org/web/20240222220738/https://sunnah.com/muslim:2933a)

> your Lord is not one-eyed


## Allah has a shin

Surah 68:42

> Beware of the Day the Shin ˹of Allah˺ will be bared, and the wicked will be asked to prostrate, but they will not be able to do so,

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4919](https://web.archive.org/web/20230125022013/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4919)

> Our Lord Allah will lay bare His Shin


## Allah has a foot

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4848](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4848)

> Allah puts His Foot over [hellfire]

## Allah was grabbed by the balls

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4830](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4830)

> Allah created His creation, and when He had finished it, the womb, got up and caught hold of [the loin of] Allah …

The translation hides the meaning of the Arabic, which says that the womb caught hold of the "حَقْوِ" (haqw) of Allah. Haqw means loin or groin area. 
This not only means that Allah has a genital area but also that he was sexually assaulted by a cunt.

## Allah needs your money

Surah 2:254

> Donate from what We have provided for you before the arrival of a Day when there will be no bargaining, friendship, or intercession. 

Give him your money before it's too late!

## Not everyone will bow before Allah

In the Bible, Philippians 2:10-11 it says:

> at the name of Jesus **every knee should bow**, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

However not everyone will be able to bow before Allah, showing that he is not the same god as the god of the Bible, and also is not worthy.

Surah 68:42

> On the Day when matters become dire, they will be invited to prostrate themselves but will be prevented from doing so

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4919](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4919)

> Such people will try to prostrate (on the Day of Judgment) but their back swill be as stiff as if it is one bone


## Allah has office hours

[Sahih al-Bukhari 582, 583](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:582)

> Allah's Messenger said, 'Do not pray at the time of sunrise and at the time of sunset.' " Ibn Umar said, "Allah's Messenger said, 'If the edge of the sun appears (above the horizon) delay the prayer till it becomes high, and if the edge of the sun disappears, delay the prayer till it sets (disappears completely).'

It seems Allah is unable to receive prayers when the earth and sun are at a specific angle with one another. Perhaps the position of the sun affects the reception? Or is his Office closed during those hours? And how does that work, since the sun is rising or setting somewhere in the world all the time?



## Allah's fatherhood

### Jews and Christians have a familial relationship with God

Surah 5:18

> The Jews and the Christians each say, “We are the children of Allah and His most beloved!”

The Quran admits Jews and Christians consider God to be their father. 

### The best Muslims can hope for us to be slaves

Surah 19:88-93

> They say, “The All-Merciful (Allah) has got a son.”… they have ascribed a son to the All-Merciful (Allah), while it does not behove the All-Merciful to have a son. There is none in the heavens and the earth, but bound to come to the All-Merciful as a salve.

## Allah is the servant of Muhammad {#allah-serves-muhammad}

Reading the Quran and Hadiths it quickly becomes painfully obvious that Allah only exists to serve Muhammad. Whatever Muhammad wants, Allah provides. 

### Aisha notices

[Sahih al Bukhari 4788](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4788)

> Narrated Aisha:… I said (to the Prophet), "I feel that your Lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires."

Even Aisha noticed that the "revelations" that Muhammad got from Allah were suspiciously self-serving. Any time Muhammad had any wish, Allah came with a convenient revelation permitting him to go ahead. Why would the creator of the universe put in so much effort to make sure one man had every wish fulfilled? It's almost like Muhammad only used Allah as a puppet to convince people to fulfill his desires.


### Islam is all about loving Muhammad

[Sahih al-Bukhari 14](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:14)

> Allah's Messenger said, "By Him in Whose Hands my life is, none of you will have faith till he loves me more than his father and his children.

### Women galore for Muhammad {#women-galore}

Surah 33:50-51

> Prophet, We have made lawful for you the wives whose bride gift you have paid, and any slaves God has assigned to you through war, and the daughters of your uncles and aunts on your father’s and mother’s sides, who migrated with you. Also any believing woman who has offered herself to the Prophet and whom the Prophet wishes to wed- this is only for you [Prophet] and not the rest of the believers…

> You may make any of [your women] wait and receive any of them as you wish, but you will not be at fault if you invite one whose turn you have previously set aside…

Regular muslim men were "only" allowed to marry 4 women, but Allah made a specific rule, included in their "holy book for people of all ages", that Muhammad, and only Muhammad, could marry as many women as he wanted, and have as many sex slaves as he wanted. And he didn't have to follow any rules regarding visiting them. This is obviously Muhammad making up rules to benefit himself and telling people that Allah said it.

### Free sex for Muhammad {#free-sex}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3959](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3959)

> It was narrated from Anas, that the Messenger of Allah had a female slave with whom he had intercourse, but 'Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: "O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.' until the end of the Verse.

Horndog that he was, Muhammad [was not satisfied with 11 wives](#eleven-wives) but started having sex with a slave girl. His wives Aisha and Hansah were upset and demanded he promise never to do it again, to which he obliged. But later Allah conveniently gave him the revelation in Surah 66:1-6 that says that Muhammad can have sex with any woman he wishes and if his wives complain about it, Allah will replace them with better wives. And he threatens them with hell for having the audacity to ask their husband to not be unfaithful. How convenient.

### Allah changed the Qiblah for Muhammad 

[Allah changed the direction all Muslims must pray just because Muhammad wanted it.](#jerusalem-qiblah)

[Sunan Ibn Majah 1010](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1010)

> When the Messenger of Allah prayed towards Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem), he would often lift his face towards the heavens, and Allah knew what was in the heart of His Prophet and how **he longed to face the Ka’bah (during prayer).** Jibril appeared (in the sky), and the Messenger of Allah started watching him as he was descending between the heavens and the earth, waiting to see what he would bring. Then Allah revealed the words: ‘Verily, We have seen the turning of your face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah **that shall please you**, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah). And wherever you people are, turn your faces (during prayer) in that direction.’ 

Allah surely did everything to please Muhammad's most frivolous whims, even changing one of the most fundamental rituals of Islam.

### Dinner instructions 

Surah 33:53

> O believers! Do not enter the homes of the Prophet without permission ˹and if invited˺ for a meal, do not ˹come too early and˺ linger until the meal is ready. But if you are invited, then enter ˹on time˺. Once you have eaten, then go on your way, and do not stay for casual talk. Such behaviour is truly annoying to the Prophet, yet he is too shy to ask you to leave. But Allah is never shy of the truth. And when you ˹believers˺ ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and theirs. And it is not right for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever marry his wives after him. This would certainly be a major offence in the sight of Allah.

Apparently Allah is even concerned about Muhammad not having to suffer the awkwardness of dismissing his dinner guests. This is obviously made up by Muhammad because he felt it too awkward to do, so he uses Allah as his puppet to order people around. 

### Don't slap your tongue {#slap-tongue}

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2853](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2853)

> the Messenger of Allah said: "Indeed Allah detests the excessive among men, who slaps his tongue around like the cow slaps his tongue."

Why would the creator of the universe be concerned with how someone moves their tongue? This is obviously Muhammad being annoyed and using Allah as an excuse to have people stop smacking their tongues while eating.

### Don't talk nonsense with Muhammad 

Surah 2: 104

> Say not (to the Messenger) words of ambiguous import, but words of respect

Allah is oddly concerned with people not annoying Muhammad with unnecessary speech.







# Animals

## Owning a dog gives you minus points {#owning-a-dog}

[Sahih al Bukhari 5480](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5480)

> "Whoever keeps a (pet) dog which is neither a watch dog nor a hunting dog, will get a daily deduction of two Qirat from his good deeds."

## Kill all dogs 

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 4276](https://sunnah.com/nasai:4276)

> the Messenger of Allah commanded that all dogs be killed, even small dogs.

- [Sunan an-Nasa'i 336](https://sunnah.com/nasai:336)

## Kill all lizards

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3231](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3231)

> the Prophet of Allah told us that when Ibrahim was thrown into the fire, there was no beast on earth that did not try to put it out, apart from the house lizard that blew on it. So the Messenger of Allah commanded that they should be killed.”



# Angels

## Angels are repelled by dogs and pictures

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4002](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4002)

> Allah's Messenger said. "Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture"







# Apostasy 

## Punishment for apostasy is being stoned to death {#apostasy-death-sentence}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2535](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2535)

> “Whoever changes his religion, execute him.”

- [Sunan Ibn Majah 2533](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2533)

# The Bible

**Note:** Muhammad was an ignoramus and did not know anything about the Bible, so when he refers to the Torah he means the Old Testament, and when he refers to the Gospel he means the New Testament.

## The Torah is the word of Allah

Surah 5:43,44

> But why do they come to you for judgment when they ˹already˺ have the Torah containing Allah’s judgment, then they turn away after all? They are not ˹true˺ believers. Indeed, We revealed the Torah, containing guidance and light, by which the prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah, made judgments for Jews. So too did the rabbis and scholars judge according to Allah’s Book, with which they were entrusted and of which they were made keepers. 

Also: Surah 32:23

See: [No one can change the word of Allah](#unchanging-word)

## The Quran says the Gospel confirms the Torah 

Surah 5:46

> Then in the footsteps of the prophets, We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah revealed before him. And We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light and confirming what was revealed in the Torah—a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing.

## The Quran confirms the Bible {#confirms-bible}

Surah 2: 88-91

> And when there comes to them a Book from Allah, **confirming what is with them**… When it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah Hath sent down, "they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us:" yet they reject all besides, even if it be Truth **confirming what is with them**…

The Quran says that it confirms "what is with them", referring to the scriptures that the Jews and Christians had in the 7th century. So according to the Quran the 7th century Bible is confirmed as authentic, uncorrupted and coming from Allah. [The problem for the liars claiming that the Bible is corrupted is that we have extant copies that are even 300](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Sinaiticus)-[900 years older than the Quran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls), and they are identical to our modern Bibles. As are all extant books and manuscripts from the 5th, 6th, 7th century and so on, showing that there has been absolutely no corruption of the meaning. This disproves the idea some Muslims put forth that the Bible has been corrupted.

- Surah 5:46,47






# Christians

## Muslims should listen to and learn from Christians and Jews {#listen-to-christians}

Surah 29:46

> Do not argue with the People of the Book unless gracefully, except with those of them who act wrongfully. 

Surah 16:43;21:7

> [Prophet], all the messengers We sent before you were simply men to whom We had given the Revelation: you [people] can ask those who have knowledge if you do not know.

Surah 10:94

> If you are in doubt about what We have revealed to you, then ask those who read the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt,

Muslims should not argue with Christians but listen and learn from them what Allah has really taught.


## Christians must judge by the Gospel

Surah 5:47

> So let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed in it. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the rebellious.










# Contradictions

## Contradicting the Bible

### Jesus was not crucified

Surah 4:157

> And because of their saying: We slew the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, Allah's messenger - they slew him not nor crucified him, but it appeared so unto them; and lo! those who disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof; they have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of a conjecture; they slew him not for certain.

The Quran denies the crucifixion of Jesus, the most verified fact of ancient history, and the pinnacle of the Bible and cornerstone of Christianity.

### Who named the animals?

Surah 2:31

> He taught Adam the names of all things, 

In the Bible it is Adam who had the task of naming all animals.

### The affliction in Egypt

Surah 2:48

> the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with dreadful torment, slaughtering your sons and keeping your women. That was a severe test from your Lord

According to the Bible, slavery in Egypt was not a trial from God but an affliction from the Egyptians. 

### Seeing God

Surah 2:55

> And ˹remember˺ when you said, “O Moses! We will never believe you until we see Allah with our own eyes,” so a thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on.

There is no such story in the Bible. Rather the Israelites were terrified and did not want to see God.

### How many springs?

Surah 2:60

> We said, “Strike the rock with your staff.” Then twelve springs gushed out

In the Bible there was only one spring.

### Breaking the sabbath

Surah 2: 65,66

> You know about those of you who broke the Sabbath, and so We said to them, ‘Be like apes! Be outcasts!’

God has never said sabbath breakers are apes. Breaking the sabbath was punished by death, not ostracism.

### Raising dead using cow parts

Surah 2:73 

> We said, ‘Strike the [body] with a part of [the cow]’: thus God brings the dead to life and shows His signs so that you may understand.

Israelites are instructed to use parts of a cow carcass to resurrect the dead.

## Contradicting the Quran

Surah 4:82

> Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Had it been from anyone other than Allah, they would have certainly found in it many inconsistencies.

If the Quran is from Allah, there should be no contradictions.


### The word of Allah both can't and can be changed

Surah 6:115; 10:64; 18:27; 50:29 says no one can change the word of Allah, but Surah 2:75 says some people did change the word of Allah.

### Allah both could and could not have offspring

Surah 6:101 says Allah could not have offspring unless he had a spouse while Surah 39:4 says Allah could just choose any creation as his offspring. 

### Who forgives sins?

Surah 3:135

> They are those who, upon committing an evil deed or wronging themselves, remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins—and who forgives sins except Allah?

Only Allah forgives sins.

Surah 46:31

> Our people, respond to the one who calls you to God. Believe in Him: He will forgive you your sins and protect you from a painful torment.’

Muhammad also forgives sins.

### How long did it take Allah to create the world?

Was it 6 days or 8 days?

Surah 10:3 says Allah created the heavens and the earth in 6 days.

> Surely your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days,...

Surah 41:9-12 says Allah created the heavens and the earth in 8 days. 2 + 4 + 2 = 8. 

> Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “How can you disbelieve in the One Who created the earth in **two Days**? And how can you set up equals with Him? That is the Lord of all worlds. He placed on the earth firm mountains, standing high, showered His blessings upon it, and ordained ˹all˺ its means of sustenance—totaling **four Days** exactly —for all who ask. ... So He formed the heaven into seven heavens in **two Days**, assigning to each its mandate. ... 

### Muhammad did and did not do miracles 

In Surah 6:37; 6:109; 13:7; 17:59; 20:20 it says that Muhammad never did any miracles. But in [Sahih al Bukhari 3637](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3637) it says that he DID do a miracle.

### Are people ransomed from hell or not.

[The Quran says there will be no ransoms whatsoever on judgment day.](#no-ransom) But one Hadith says [muslims will be ransomed from hell by Christians and Jews taking their places in hell.](#ransomed-from-hell).

### Jews are both favoured and not

Surah 45:16

> Indeed, We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture, wisdom, and prophethood; granted them good, lawful provisions; and favoured them above the others.

Surah 2:47

> Children of Israel, remember how I blessed you and favoured you over other people.

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2926](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2926)

> …"The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."

Jews are favoured by Allah, but Islam has as a main goal to kill all Jews.

### Wine is from Satan but is served in paradise {#satanic-wine-in-paradise}

Surah 5:90

> O you who believe! **Wine**, gambling, altars and divining arrows **are filth, made up by Satan**. Therefore, refrain from it, so that you may be successful.

Surah 83:22-26

> Surely the virtuous will be in bliss, ˹seated˺ on ˹canopied˺ couches, gazing around. You will recognize on their faces the glow of delight. **They will be given a drink of sealed, pure wine, whose last sip will smell like musk.** So let whoever aspires to this strive ˹diligently˺.

Why does Allah in Paradise serve a drink that is "filth made up by Satan"?

See also Surah 37:43-46; 47:15



# Convenient revelations

One feature that keeps showing up in Islamic sources is the fact that whenever Muhammad has any kind of setback or minor inconvenience, suddenly Allah comes with a convenient revelation to solve it for him. It's quite obvious that he perpetrated a self-serving scam.

- [When the wives of Muhammad complained that he was having sex with a slave girl, Allah steps in and says that he is allowed to.](#muhammads-sex-slave)











# Death

## Grieving tortures the deceased 


[Sahih al-Bukhari 1286, 1287, 1288](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1286)

> Allah's Messenger has said, 'The dead person is tortured by the crying of his relatives?"


[Riyad as-Salihin 1657](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1657)

> The Prophet said, "The deceased is tortured in his grave for bewailing over him."






# Errors 

Historical and factual errors 

## Jews think Ezra is the son of Allah {#ezra-son-of-allah}

Surah 9:30

> The Jews say, “Ezra is the son of Allah,” …

This is false. No Jews have ever claimed that Ezra is the son of God. Is it Allah or Muhammad who is ignorant of this fact?

## The Quran gets the trinity wrong {#trinity}

Surah 5:73

> They do blaspheme who say: Allah is one of three in a Trinity: for there is no god except One Allah.

This is an obvious reference to the trinity doctrine. However the trinity doctrine doesn't say that God or Allah is "one of three". That would be tritheism. It says that God is one in essence and three in persons. The Quran is wrong. 

## The Quran confuses the Holy Spirit with the Angel Gabriel 

Surah 19:17

When Mary is visited by Gabriel:

> And had chosen seclusion from them. Then We sent unto her **Our Spirit** and it assumed for her the likeness of a perfect man.

The spirit of Allah, i.e. the Holy Spirit comes in the shape of a man (see Ezekiel 8) to Mary. But it was the Angel Gabriel who came to Mary.

## Christians worship Mary {#worshipping-mary}

Surah 5:116

> And ˹on Judgment Day˺ Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Did you ever ask the people to worship you and your mother as gods besides Allah?”...

Christians don't worship Mary. But Allah doesn't know this.

## Mary the mother of Jesus is the brother of Aaron {#who-is-mary}

Surah 19:27-28

> Then she returned to her people, carrying him [Jesus]. They said ˹in shock˺, “O Mary! You have certainly done a horrible thing! O  sister of Aaron! Your father was not an indecent man, nor was your mother unchaste.”

Surah 66:12

> Mary, daughter of Imran. 

See also Surah 3:35-36.

- Mary the mother of Jesus lived Judaea/Galilee. 
- Mariam the sister of Aaron and daughter of Imran (Amram) lived in Egypt/Sinai.
- Mary lived ca 1st century B.C./A.D.
- Mariam lived ca 1400-1500 B.C. one and a half millenium earlier.
- Mary was of the tribe of Judah.
- Mariam was of the tribe of Levi.
- Mary's father was probably named Joachim.
- Mariam father was named Amram.

These are two totally different people, and the author of the Quran is so ignorant that he mixes them up and thinks they're the same people. 

## Pharao ordered Haman to build the Tower of Babel {#pharao-haman-tower}

Surah 40:36

> Pharaoh ordered, “O Hamân! Build me a high tower so I may reach the pathways leading up to the heavens and look for the God of Moses, although I am sure he is a liar.” …

The Pharao was the king of Egypt. Haman was an Amalekite man, an enemy of Israel, who lived in the Persian empire in the 5th century BC, a thousand years later. And the Tower of Babel was built on the plains of Mesopotamia in the 24th century BC, almost a thousand years before. This is the worst imaginable mishmash of stories and characters picked from a time frame of two thousand years.

## Pharao threatened people with crucifixion {#egyptian-crucifixion}

Surah 7:123-124

> Pharaoh threatened, … "I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then crucify you all.”

Crucifixion was never used by ancient Egypt, and did not become a common form of execution by the Romans in the 6th century BC.

- Surah 20:71
- Surah 25:49

## The Israelites were misled by a Samaritan {#misled-by-samaritan}

Surah 20:85

> Allah responded, “We have indeed tested your people in your absence, and the Samaritan has led them astray.

The Samaritan people did not exist until at least a thousand years after the event where the Israelites were misled into worshipping the golden calf.

## Jesus was not crucified {#no-crucifixion}

Surah 4:157

> and their saying, “We have surely killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah. ”In fact, they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them as if they had. And indeed, those who differed over him are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it—just following assumptions. And certainly, they did not kill him.

That Jesus was crucified by order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate is subject to "almost universal assent" among scholars. Lightfoot Professor of Divinity James Dunn stated that the fact of the baptism and crucifixion of Jesus "rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts, they are obvious starting points for an attempt to clarify the what and why of Jesus' mission." Atheist scholar Bart Ehrman says "Nearly all critical scholars agree at least on those points about the historical Jesus."

In other words, the Quran is historically false.

## No one was named John before John the Baptist

Surah 19:7 

> “O Zachariah! Indeed, We give you the good news of a son, whose name will be John—a name We have not given to anyone before.”

John is not a unique name. in fact it was one of the most popular names in the first century. There are at least 5 people in the New testament named John. The Hebrew equivalent of the name John is "Johanan" and "Jehohanan", which means "Yahweh is gracious." There are at least 17 persons in the old testament with this name, for a total of 22 people in the whole Bible. So Allah and the Quran are wrong that John was the first one with this name.
