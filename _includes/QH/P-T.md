# Paradise

The Islamic paradise is a very physical place where people will have sex, and eat food. But the food all tastes the same, and they will not poop, but belch out the excrement as musk.

## All fruit looks the same in paradise {#boring-fruit}

[Quran 2:25](https://quran.com/2/25)

> And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens under which rivers flow. Every time they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” for they will be given fruit that resemble one another. They will have purified spouses, and they will abide therein forever.

## Paradise dwellers don't poop but belch and sweat musk {#belching-musk}

> I heard Allah's Apostle as saying that the inmates of Paradise would eat and drink but would neither spit, nor pass water, nor void excrement, nor suffer catarrah. It was said: Then, what would happen with food? Thereupon he said: They would belch and sweat (and it would be over with their food), and their sweat would be that of musk and they would glorify and praise Allah as easily as you breathe.

## Paradise dwellers will have large-eyed houris {#houris}

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their wives will be large-eyed maidens...

## Paradise dwellers will be about 30 years old 

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2545](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2545)

> The people of Paradise shall enter Paradise without body hair, Murd, with Kuhl on their eyes, thirty years of age or thirty-three years.

## Paradise dwellers will be 38 meters tall {#tall-people}

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their form would be alike as one single person after the form of their father (Adam) sixty cubits tall.

60 Arabic cubits á 64cm each equals 38.4 meters.

## Huge tree

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3252](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3252)

> The Prophet said "There is a tree in Paradise (which is so big and huge that) a rider could travel in its shade for a hundred years.

## There are 7 heavens {#seven-heavens}

Surah 2:29

> It is He Who created for you all that is in the earth, then He turned towards the heaven and made them seven heavens...








# Prayer

## Looking up while praying makes you go blind {#praying-blind}

[Sahih al Bukhari 750](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:750)

> The Prophet said, "What is wrong with those people who look towards the sky during the prayer?" His talk grew stern while delivering this speech and he said, "They should stop (looking towards the sky during the prayer); otherwise their eyesight would be taken away."

## Looking up while praying turns your head into a donkey head {#praying-donkey}

[Sahih al Bukhari 691](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:691)

> The Prophet said, "Isn't he who raises his head before the Imam afraid that Allah may transform his head into that of a donkey or his figure into that of a donkey?"

## Prayer is nullified by donkeys, black dogs and women {#nullified-prayer}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 750](https://sunnah.com/nasai:750)

> If he does not have something as high as the back of a camel saddle in front of him, then his prayer is nullified by a woman, a donkey or a black dog."

[Sahih al-Bukhari 511](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:511)

> Narrated Aisha: The things which annul the prayers were mentioned before me. They said, "Prayer is annulled by a dog, a donkey and a woman (if they pass in front of the praying people)."

## Muslims pray to Muhammad 

This is not part of the Quran or Hadiths but it is worth mentioning since this is part of the Tashahhud, a section of the prayer that all faithful Muslims recite five times every day. In that prayer is a section that goes:

> ٱلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ ٱللَّٰهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ.

> as-salāmu ʿalayka ʿayyuhā n-nabīyu wa-raḥmatu -llāhi wa-barakātuhu, 

> "Peace be upon you, O Prophet, as well as God's mercy and His blessings. 

Notice that this is not talking *about* Muhammad, but *to* Muhammad. Muhammad is dead and gone, yet billions of times a day, people are addressing him as if he was alive and able to hear them. In other words this is a prayer directed toward Muhammad. Muslims are praying to Muhammad.









# The Quran {#quran}

## The original Quranic manuscripts were burned 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4987](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4987)

> ... So Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, "Send us the manuscripts of the Qur'an so that we may compile the Qur'anic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you."...Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Qur'anic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt.

We have no way of confirming that the current Quran is uncorrupted or even the same as the message Muhammad delivered.

## The Quran confirms the Bible {#confirms-bible}

Surah 2: 88-91

> And when there comes to them a Book from Allah, **confirming what is with them**… When it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah Hath sent down, "they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us:" yet they reject all besides, even if it be Truth **confirming what is with them**…

The Quran confirms the Bible that was available in the 7th century as being uncorrupted and coming from Allah. [We have extant copies that are even 300](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Sinaiticus)-[900 years older than the Quran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls), and they are identical to our modern Bibles. This disproves the idea some Muslims put forth that the Bible has been corrupted.

## Proof of inspiration {#proof-of-inspiration}

Surah 2:23-24

> 23 If you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down upon Our slave, then produce a chapter like it and call upon your helpers other than Allah, if you are truthful.24 But if you did not do it, and you can never do it; then beware of the Fire whose fuel will be people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers.

The only claim to inspiration the Quran makes is in its literary excellence, claiming no one can produce a chapter like it. But if you have read it the first thing that strikes you is that literary speaking, it is garbage. Even a mediocre poet would be able to write a chapter far more excellent than most chapters of the Quran.

## The Quran is not perfectly preserved {#not-preserved}

One miraculous claim made is that the Quran has been perfectly preserved. However the Quran and Hadiths contradict this.

## Allah foretold that the Quran wouldn’t be perfectly preserved {#no-preservation}

Surah 2:106

> If We ever abrogate a verse or **cause it to be forgotten**, We replace it with a better or similar one. Do you not know that Allah is Most Capable of everything?

## The Quran was corrupted even during Muhammad's lifetime {#early-corruption}


[Sahih al-Bukhari 2410](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2410)

> I heard a man reciting a verse (of the Holy Qur'an) but I had heard the Prophet reciting it differently. So, I caught hold of the man by the hand and took him to Allah's Messenger who said, "Both of you are right."


## Two chapters of the Quran were forgotten {#surahs-forgotten}

[Sahih Muslim 1050](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1050)

> Abu Harb b. Abu al-Aswad… We used to recite a surah which resembled in length and severity to (Surah) Bara'at. **I have, however, forgotten it** with the exception of this which I remember out of it:" If there were two valleys full of riches, for the son of Adam, he would long for a third valley, and nothing would fill the stomach of the son of Adam but dust." And we used so recite a surah which resembled one of the surahs of Musabbihat, and **I have forgotten it**, but remember (this much) out of it:" Oh people who believe, why do you say that which you do not practise" and" that is recorded in your necks as a witness (against you) and you would be asked about it on the Day of Resurrection"

This reciter admits that they **used to recite** two surahs meaning it was once part of the Quran, but that they just forgot them. He remembers some fragments, but these match nothin in the Quran, proving that these surahs are gone forever. This proves the Quran has not been perfectly preserved.

## Two chapters of the Quran were eaten by a sheep {#sheep-ate-surahs}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 1944](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1944)

> It was narrated that 'Aishah said “The Verse of stoning and of breastfeeding an adult ten times was revealed, and the paper was with me under my pillow. When the Messenger of Allah died, we were preoccupied with his death, and a tame sheep came in and ate it.”

How can the Quran be perfectly preserved when two Surah's were literally eaten by a sheep?

## Chapters of the Quran could be ordered on demand {#surah-on-demand}

[Sahih al Bukhari 4483](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4483)

> I also said, 'O Allah's Messenger ! Good and bad persons visit you! Would that you ordered the Mothers of the believers to cover themselves with veils.' So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were revealed. 

Apparently, chapters could be requested on demand by the followers of Muhammad to suit their personal preferences. How convenient.

## Denying a Quran verse is a capital offense {#denying-quran}

> It was narrated from Ibn'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah said:
> “Whoever denies a Verse of the Qur'an, it is permissible to strike his neck (i.e., execute him) 

See also [Apostasy](#apostasy)

## A Christian wrote the Quran

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3617](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3617)

> There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read Surat-al-Baqara and Al-Imran, and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: "Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him."

At least part of the Quran was written down by, or edited by a Christian convert to Islam (and later re-convert to Christianity). He claimed to understand it better than Muhammad.


## The Quran is alive and will intercede on judgment day {#quran-intercession}

[Sahih Muslim 804 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:804a)

> Recite the Qur'an, for on the Day of Resurrection it will come as an intercessor for those who recite It. Recite the two bright ones, al-Baqara and Surah Al 'Imran, for on the Day of Resurrection they will come as two clouds or two shades, or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them.

Islam teaches that the Quran is actually alive and will function as an intercessor on the day of judgment. It will come as clouds, shades, or flocks of birds, and it will speak, pleading for Muslims.

# Racism

## Blacks are worth half as much

Muhammad owned and traded black slaves. The going rate was two black slaves for one Arabic slave. 

See [Muhammad traded black slaves](#black-slaves).


## Black people were created for hell {#blacks-made-for-hell}

[Mishkat al-Masabih 119](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:119)

> …“God created Adam when He created him and struck his right shoulder and brought forth his offspring white like small ants. And he struck his left shoulder and brought forth his offspring black as though they were charcoal. Then He said to the party on his right side, ‘To paradise, and I do not care’ and He said to the party in his left shoulder, ‘To hell, and I do not care’.”

According to Muhammed, white people are destined for heaven and black people are destined for hell.

## Those condemned by Allah turns black {#blackface-hell}

Surah 3:106-107

> on a day when some faces are whitened and some faces are blackened. So as for those whose faces were blackened: “Did you deny after having attained faith?” Then taste the punishment on account of what you used to deny. And as for those whose faces were whitened—(they are) in Allah’s mercy; therein they abide.

## Black people symbolize disease {#black-disease}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 7039](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7039)

> …I saw in a dream a black woman with unkempt hair going out of Medina and settling at Mahai'a. I interpreted that as a symbol of the epidemic of Medina being transferred to Mahai'a…

When Muhammad sees a black woman in a dream he automatically assumes she represents an epidemic.


## Turks look like their faces were hit with a hammer {#turks}

[Sahih Muslim 2912 d](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2912d)

> The Last Hour would not come until the Muslims fight with the Turks-a people whose faces would be like hammered shields wearing clothes of hair and walking (with shoes) of hair.

Another description of Turks:

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2928](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2928)

> …The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Turks; people with small eyes, red faces, and flat noses. Their faces will look like shields coated with leather…

## Ethiopians have heads like raisins {#raisin-heads}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 693](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:693)

> "Listen and obey (your chief) even if an Ethiopian whose head is like a raisin were made your chief."

See also [Sahih al-Bukhari 7142](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7142)

## Muhammad didn't like black dogs {#black-dogs}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3205](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3205)

> Were it not that dogs form one of the communities, I would have commanded that they be killed. But kill those that are all black...

## Black dogs are satanic

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 750](https://sunnah.com/nasai:750)

> I (one of the narrators)said: "What is the difference between a black dog, a yellow one and a red one?" He said: I asked the Messenger of Allah just like you and he said:"The black dog is a shaitan."








# Rape

## Captured women may be raped freely {#raping-captives}

[Sunan Abi Dawud 2155](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2155)

> Abu Sa’id Al Khudri said “The Apostle of Allaah sent a military expedition to Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain. They met their enemy and fought with them. They defeated them and took them captives. Some of the Companions of Apostle of Allah were reluctant to have relations with the female captives because of their pagan husbands. So, Allaah the exalted sent down the Qur’anic verse “And all married women are forbidden unto you save those captives whom your right hand posses.” This is to say that they are lawful for them when they complete their waiting period.

**Those captives whom your right hand posses** means captives taken in war. The Muslims at this battle, horny perverts though they were, at least had the basic human decency of not raping women in front of their husbands. So this verse that Muhammad conveniently came up with makes it permissible for Muslim men to rape women that they take captive.

[Quran 4:24](https://quran.com/4/24)

> Also ˹forbidden are˺ married women—except ˹female˺ captives in your possession...

## Impregnating rape victims is of no concern

[Sahih Muslim 1438a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1438a)

> We went out with Allah's Messenger on the expedition to the Bi'l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing [interrupted coitus]. But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah's Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah's Messenger, and he said: It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born.

Not only are Muslims allowed to rape women, but can just discard them like trash and not bother about them becoming pregnant.



# Resurrection 

## The hour of resurrection 

Surah 22:6-7

> That is because Allâh: He is the Truth, and it is He Who gives life to the dead, and it is He Who is Able to do all things. And surely, the Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it; and certainly, Allâh will resurrect those who are in the graves.

The one who is called the truth, and who will raise people to life at the hour of resurrection is God. Let's see what the Bible says.

John 5:25,28,29 

> “Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live....28 Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice 29 and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.

John 14:6 

> Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

The one who is called the truth, and who will raise people to life at the hour of resurrection is Jesus. So the Quran admits that Jesus is God.



# Salvation 

How Muslims are saved on judgment day is confusing and contradictory.

## Jews and Christians are also saved

Surah 2:62

> The [Muslim] believers, the Jews, the Christians, and the Sabians- all those who believe in God and the Last Day and do good- will have their rewards with their Lord. 

## No ransom 

Surah 2:48

> Guard yourselves against a Day when no soul will stand in place of another, no intercession will be accepted for it, nor any ransom; nor will they be helped.

So there will be no ransom for anyone. This contradicts [other sources saying that Muslims can be ransomed](#ransomed-from-hell). 


## Ransomed from hell by Jews and Christians {#ransomed-from-hell}

[Sahih Muslim 2767 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2767a)

> Abu Musa' reported that Allah's Messenger said:
> When it will be the Day of Resurrection Allah would deliver to every Muslim a Jew or a Christian and say: That is your rescue from Hell-Fire.

Christianity teaches that Jesus is the perfect one who does not deserve hellfire but took this punishment in stead of those who have faith in him. Some Muslims think this is unjust saying that it's wrong that someone should take the punishment for someone else's sin. However here, Allah will let Jews and Christians take the punishment for the sins of Muslims. Is that just, though?

Als this implies that Jews and Christians as not sinners deserving of hell, but that Muslims are sinners deserving of hell. Otherwise, if the Jews and Christians were already in hell, the exchange could not be made.

## The Quran will come and intercede 


See [The Quran is alive and will intercede on judgment day](#quran-intercession). It will come as a flock of birds and convince Allah to have mercy on those who read it.

## Muhammad can save {#muhammad-saves}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6807](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6807)

> The Prophet said, "Whoever guarantees me what is between his legs and what is between his jaws, I guarantee him Paradise."

## Muhammad can NOT save {#muhammad-saves-not}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2753](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2753)

> Allah's Messenger got up and said, "O people of Quraish! Save yourselves from the Hellfire as I cannot save you from Allah's Punishment; O Bani Abd Manaf! I cannot save you from Allah's Punishment, O Safiya, the Aunt of Allah's Messenger! I cannot save you from Allah's Punishment; O Fatima bint Muhammad! Ask me anything from my wealth, but I cannot save you from Allah's Punishment."


## The black stone will intercede 

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 961](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:961)

> The Messenger of Allah said about the Black Stone: "By Allah! Allah will raise it on the Day of Resurrection with two eyes by which it sees and a tongue that it speaks with, testifying to whoever touched it in truth."

So Allah does not know who have and have not touched it? 

The fact that "the black stone" is broken into 8 pieces held together by glue is also a big problem since there really is no black stone. Are the 8 pieces going to join together? Or are they going to each get a set of eyes and mouth?

## Muhammad will intercede for those dying in Medina

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3917](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3917)

> the Prophet said: "Whoever is able to die in Al-Madinah, then let him die there, for I will intercede for those who die 

## Invading India or being Christian ensures salvation

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3175](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3175)

> The Messenger of Allah said: 'There are two groups of my Ummah whom Allah will free from the Fire: The group that invades India, and the group that will be with 'Isa bin Maryam, peace be upon him.'"

## Memorizing 99 names ensures salvation 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 7392](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7392)

> Allah's Messenger said, "Allah has ninety-nine Names, one-hundred less one; and he who memorized them all by heart will enter Paradise." 


## Allah is a fickle and arbitrary judge

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2599](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2599)

> "Indeed two men among those who entered the Fire will be screaming violently.  So the Lord, Blessed and Exalted, will say: 'Take them out.'  Then when they are taken out He will say: 'What caused you to scream so violently?'

Is Allah stupid or just cruel?

> They will say: 'We did that so You would have mercy on us.' He will say: 'My mercy for you is that you both go and throw yourselves where you were in the Fire.' 

How is it mercy to tell someone to throw themselves into hellfire? Seems like something Saw would do.

> So they will go. One of them will throw himself in, and He will make it cool and peaceful for him. 

How is it justice to randomly make hell comfortable for a sinner? Allah is not consistent at all.

> And the other will stand there and not throw himself in, so the Lord, Mighty and Majestic, will say to him: 'What prevented you from throwing yourself in as your companion did?' He will say: 'O Lord! I hope that you will not return me to it after You have taken me out.' 

Understandable. This guy doesn't play Allah's manipulative games.

> So the Lord, Blessed and Exalted, will say to him: 'For you is what you hoped for,' and so they will both enter Paradise together by the mercy of Allah."

So he is pardoned for not accepting Allahs "mercy" of throwing himself into hell? And the other guy was also taken with him to paradise? Allah has proven to be neither merciful, nor just, nor consistent, but fickle and arbitrary and completely illogical.







# Satan

## Bells are Satanic {#satanic-bells}

[Sahih Muslim 2114](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2114)

> The bell is the musical instrument of the Satan.

Funny since in [Sahih al Bukhari 2](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2)  Muhammad says that his revelations were often like the ringing of a bell, so you don't have to wonder about it's true source.

> Al-Harith bin Hisham asked Allah's Messenger "O Allah's Messenger! How is the Divine Inspiration revealed to you?" Allah's Messenger replied, "Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of all and then this state passes off after I have grasped what is inspired.

## Donkeys are Satan detectors {#donkeys-detect-satan}

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3459](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3459)

> When you hear the braying of a donkey, then seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, for, verily, it has seen a Shaitan.

## Satan farts to not hear the call to prayer {#satan-farts}

[Sahih Muslim 389a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:389a)

> When Satan hears the call to prayer, he turns back and breaks the wind so as not to hear the call being made...


## Satan sleeps in your nostrils

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3295](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3295)

> The Prophet said, "If anyone of you rouses from sleep and performs the ablution, he should wash his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out thrice, because Satan has stayed in the upper part of his nose all the night.

[Bulugh al-Maram 37](https://sunnah.com/bulugh:37)

> Allah’s Messenger said: “When one of you wakes up from his sleep, he must blow of his nose three times, for the Satan spends the night inside one’s nostrils”

## Satan pisses in your ear {#satan-pisses}

[Sahih al Bukhari 1144](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1144)

> Narrated 'Abdullah: A person was mentioned before the Prophet and he was told that he had kept on sleeping till morning and had not got up for the prayer. The Prophet said, "Satan urinated in his ears."

## Yawning is Satanic {#satanic-yawning}

[Sahih al Bukhari 3289](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3289)

> Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, "Yawning is from Satan and if anyone of you yawns, he should check his yawning as much as possible, for if anyone of you (during the act of yawning) should say: 'Ha', Satan will laugh at him."

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2746](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2746)

> Allah loves the sneeze and He dislikes the Yawn, so when a man says Ah, Ah when yawning, indeed Ash-Shaitan laughs from inside his opening.

## Night prayers ensures satanic possession

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4950](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4950)

> Once Allah's Messenger became sick and could not offer his night prayer (Tahajjud) for two or three nights. Then a lady (the wife of Abu Lahab) came and said, "O Muhammad! I think that your Satan has forsaken you, for I have not seen him with you for two or three nights!"

So by avoiding praying the night prayer for two or three nights, Satan left Muhammad for those two or three nights. That means that praying the night prayer means Satan will come to oppress you.

## Satan can't open lids

[Riyad as-Salihin 1654](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1654)

> Cover up the (kitchen) containers (i.e., pots, pans, etc.), tie up the mouth of the water-skin, lock up the doors and extinguish the lamps, because Satan can neither untie the water-skin nor open the door nor uncover the containers.










# Science

## The coccyx does not decay {#coccyx}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4935](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4935)

> There is nothing of the human body that does not decay except one bone; that is the little bone at the end of the coccyx of which the human body will be recreated on the Day of Resurrection.

I'm pretty sure it does, eventually.


## The earth existed before space {#earth-before-space}

Surah 2:29

> He is the One Who created everything in the earth for you. Then He turned towards the heaven, forming it into seven heavens. 

## The earth is flat {#flat-earth}

[Quran 18:86](https://quran.com/71/19?translations=207)

> Allah has laid the earth out as a carpet for you,

## The sky can fall down

Surah 23:65

> He keeps the heavens from falling down on the earth without His permission


## Sperm comes from between the backbone and the ribs {#backbone-sperm}

Surah 86:6-7

> ˹They were˺ created from a spurting fluid, stemming from between the backbone and the ribcage.

## The sun sets in a muddy spring {#sun-sets-in-mud}

[Quran 18:86](https://quran.com/18/86?translations=17)

> Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a muddy spring, and he found a people at it. We said, "O Thulqarnayn, either you will torment them or you will take to yourself towards them a fair way."

## The sun might rise from the west

[Sahih al-Bukhari 7424](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7424)

> the Prophet said, "O Abu Dharr! Do you know where this (sun) goes?" I said, "Allah and His Apostle know best." He said, "It goes and asks permission to prostrate, and it is allowed, and (one day) it, as if being ordered to return whence it came, then it will rise from the west."



## What determines if a child looks like its mother or father? {#whom-children-resemble}

[Sahih al Bukhari 3329](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3329)

> If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife and gets discharge first, the child will resemble the father, and if the woman gets discharge first, the child will resemble her.

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 200](https://sunnah.com/nasai:200)

> 'The man's water is thick and white, and the woman's water is thin and yellow. Whichever of them comes first, the child will resemble (that parent).'"

## Gestation

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6594](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6594)

> Allah's Messenger, the truthful and truly-inspired, said, "Each one of you collected in the womb of his mother for forty days, and then turns into a clot for an equal period (of forty days) and turns into a piece of flesh for a similar period (of forty days) and then … the soul is breathed into him.

This description of gestation is entirely unscientific. A fetus does not go through three forty day periods of being 


## Mosquito wings carry both diseases and cures

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3320](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3320)

> The Prophet said "If a house fly falls in the drink of anyone of you, he should dip it (in the drink) and take it out, for one of its wings has a disease and the other has the cure for the disease."









# Sex slaves

See also [Muhammad had a sex slave](#muhammad-had-a-sex-slave), [Rape](#rape), [Women](#women).

## Muslims men can have sex slaves

Surah 4:3 

> If you fear you might fail to give orphan women their ˹due˺ rights ˹if you were to marry them˺, then marry other women of your choice—two, three, or four. But if you are afraid you will fail to maintain justice, then ˹content yourselves with˺ one or those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession.

The footnote on quran.com says "A bondwoman is **a female slave** that a man owned either through purchase or taking her captive in war".

A muslim man can freely use his female slaves for sex.

Surah 33:50

> O Prophet! We have **made lawful** for you your wives to whom you have paid their ˹full˺ dowries as well as those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession, whom Allah has granted you... We have ordained for the believers in relation to their wives and those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession.

"Made lawful" means that he can have sex with female slaves.

Surah 23:5-6; 70:29-30

> [Sucessful are the believers...] those who guard their chastity except with their wives or those [bondswomen] in their possession, for then they are free from blame

This passage says that a muslim should be chaste except with their wives (plural) or "those their right hand posesses", which would be women they have taken captive in war or bought as slaves. It's allowed for muslim men to have slaves that they have sex with and these slave women can not refuse them.

Surah 4:24

> Also ˹forbidden are˺ married women—except ˹female˺ captives in your possession.

They're not allowed to have sex with married women **except** if these **married women** have been captured in battle. Then it is allowed to have sex with these **married women**.







# Sin

## Allah predetermines adultery

[Sahih Muslim 2657 b](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2657b)

> Verily Allah has fixed the very portion of adultery which a man will indulge in, and which he of necessity must commit.

A man who commits adultery is really only doing the will of Allah, and has no choice in it.

## Who forgives sins?

### Only Allah forgives sins

Surah 3:135

> They are those who, upon committing an evil deed or wronging themselves, remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins—and who forgives sins except Allah?

### But Muhammad also forgives sins 

Surah 46:31

> Our people, respond to the one who calls you to God. Believe in Him: He will forgive you your sins and protect you from a painful torment.’




# Slavery

See also [Muhammad and slavery](#muhammad-and-slavery), [Sex slaves](#sex-slaves)

## Runaway slaves lack protection

[Mishkat al-Masabih 3350](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:3350)

> If any slave runs away protection does not apply to him.

Compare to the Mosaic law in Deuteronomy 23:15-16:

> “You shall not give up to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you. He shall dwell with you, in your midst, in the place that he shall choose within one of your towns, wherever it suits him. You shall not wrong him.

## Gifting slaves is better than freeing them

[Sahih Muslim 999](https://sunnah.com/muslim:999)

> Maimuna bint Harith reported that she set free a slave-girl during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah and she made a mention of that to the Messenger of Allah and he said: Had you given her to your maternal uncles, you would have a greater reward.

## Value of slaves

[Muwatta Malik Book 20, Hadith 243](https://sunnah.com/urn/409590)

> The value of the newly-born slave is fifty dinars, and that is one-tenth of what the blood-money for the mother would be.

## Black slaves are worth half of Arab slaves {#black-slaves-worth-less}

See [Muhammad traded black slaves](#black-slaves), [Racism](#racism).
