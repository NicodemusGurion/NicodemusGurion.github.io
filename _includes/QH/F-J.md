## Muslims aren’t allowed to urinate standing {#no-urinating-standing}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 308](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:308) 

> … 'Umar said: "The Messenger of Allah saw me urinating while standing, and he said: 'O 'Umar, do not urinate standing up.' So I never urinated whilst standing after that."

## Muslims aren’t allowed to urinate in water {#no-urinating-in-water}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 343](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:343) 

> …The Messenger of Allah forbade urinating into standing water.

So it seems our Muslim brothers can not urinate into a water toilet, especially not standing up.

## Dogs would urinate in the mosque and no one would clean it up

[Sahih al-Bukhari 174](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:174)

> And narrated Hamza bin 'Abdullah: My father said. "During the lifetime of Allah's Apostle, the dogs used to urinate, and pass through the mosques (come and go), nevertheless they never used to sprinkle water on it (urine of the dog.)"









# Islam

## Self-serving

These are verses and Hadiths that show that "Allah" is nothing but a puppet that Muhammad used to make people do his will.

### Even Aisha 

[Sahih al Bukhari 4788](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4788)

> Narrated Aisha:… I said (to the Prophet), "I feel that your Lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires."

Even Aisha noticed that the "revelations" that Muhammad got from Allah were suspiciously self-serving, affording him all sorts of luxuries and privileges.

In this case she referred to Muhammad's special privilege have as many women as he wanted:

### Women galore 

Surah 33:50-51

> Prophet, We have made lawful for you the wives whose bride gift you have paid, and any slaves God has assigned to you through war, and the daughters of your uncles and aunts on your father’s and mother’s sides, who migrated with you. Also any believing woman who has offered herself to the Prophet and whom the Prophet wishes to wed- this is only for you [Prophet] and not the rest of the believers…

> You may make any of [your women] wait and receive any of them as you wish, but you will not be at fault if you invite one whose turn you have previously set aside…

Regular muslim men were "only" allowed to marry 4 women, but Allah made a specific rule, that is included in their holy book for the ages, that Muhammad, and only Muhammad, could marry as many women as he wanted and have as many sex slaves as he wanted. And he didn't have to follow any rules regarding visiting them. This is obviously Muhammad making up rules to benefit himself and telling people that Allah said it.

### Allowing free sex

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3959](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3959)

> It was narrated from Anas, that the Messenger of Allah had a female slave with whom he had intercourse, but 'Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: "O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.' until the end of the Verse.

Horndog that he was, Muhammad [was not satisfied with 11 wives](#eleven-wives) but started having sex with a slave girl. His wives Aisha and Hansah were upset and demanded he promise never to do it again, to which he obliged. But later Allah conveniently gave him the revelation in Surah 66:1-6 that says that Muhammad can have sex with any woman he wishes and if his wives complain about it, Allah will replace them with better wives. And he threatens them with hell for having the audacity to ask their husband to not be unfaithful. How convenient.

### Dinner instructions 

Surah 33:53

> O believers! Do not enter the homes of the Prophet without permission ˹and if invited˺ for a meal, do not ˹come too early and˺ linger until the meal is ready. But if you are invited, then enter ˹on time˺. Once you have eaten, then go on your way, and do not stay for casual talk. Such behaviour is truly annoying to the Prophet, yet he is too shy to ask you to leave. But Allah is never shy of the truth. And when you ˹believers˺ ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and theirs. And it is not right for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever marry his wives after him. This would certainly be a major offence in the sight of Allah.

Apparently Allah is even concerned about Muhammad not having to suffer the awkwardness of dismissing his dinner guests. This is obviously made up by Muhammad because he felt it too awkward to do, so he uses Allah as his puppet to order people around.

### Don't smack your tongue

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2853](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2853)

> the Messenger of Allah said: "Indeed Allah detests the excessive among men, who slaps his tongue around like the cow slaps his tongue."

Why would the creator of the universe be concerned with how someone moves their tongue? This is obviously Muhammad being annoyed and using Allah as an excuse to have people stop smacking their tongues while eating.









# Jews

## The verse Muslims use to lie that Islam is peaceful {#peaceful}

Surah 5:32

> That is why We ordained **for the Children of Israel** that whoever takes a life—**unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land**—it will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity. ˹Although˺ Our messengers already came to them with clear proofs, many of them still transgressed afterwards through the land.

This verse is often quoted by Muslims doing Taqqiya to say that Islam is peaceful. But as you can see, it is a command directed to the people of Israel, not Muslims. 

It is a quotation from the Talmud. So the Quran is actually saying that the commentary by a rabbi in the Talmud is "revelation from Allah."

Also notice that this command has the stipulation "unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land", meaning that Jews had the right of capital punishment for those spreading mischief in the land. But in other cases, killing one would be like killing all. 

And what "land" is it talking about? Well, the land of the Jews, Israel, or Palestine as it was later renamed. 

*So according to the Quran, the Jews has the right to execute capital punishment on those spreading mischief in the land of Israel.*

But wait, it gets better. The next verse is what applies to Muslims:

Surah 5:33

> Indeed, the penalty **for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger** and spread mischief in the land is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land.** This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous **punishment in the Hereafter.**

This is directed to Muslims, how to deal with those who "who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land". The Muslims are to kill, crucify, dismember and exile people. And after they die, Allah sends them to hell."

## Islam's Final Solution to the Jewish Question {#final-solution}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2926](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2926)

> …"The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."












# Jihad

See also [Violence](#violence) and [Muhammad and violence](#muhammad-and-violence).

## Jizya

[Sahih Muslim 1731a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1731a)

> …If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them.…

This is the future of your country if you invite Islam: They will sooner or later take over, and if you do not join their ideology, you will have to pay a tax to them. And if you refuse to pay them, they will kill you.

## Even stones will help jihadists to kill Jews 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2926](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2926)

> …"The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."

## Muslims can indiscriminately kill innocent civilians 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3012](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012)

> The Prophet … was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, "They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)." I also heard the Prophet saying, "[The institution of Hima (sanctuary)](#hima) is invalid except for Allah and His Apostle."

So his men, having a shred of humanity, asked about the possibility of killing non-combatant women and children. Muhammad said that it doesn't matter, they're all the same, so it's ok to kill innocent civilians. No mercy.

### "Hima"

In the context of warfare in Islamic teachings, the term "hima" is sometimes used to denote a protected zone or area during times of conflict. It signifies a space where civilians and their property are safeguarded from harm. The Prophet Muhammad emphasized the importance of protecting Muslim non-combatants, including women, children, and the elderly, and avoiding unnecessary destruction during warfare. As pointed out in [Sahih al-Bukhari 3012](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012), Hima is invalid for non-Muslims though. Muslims do not need to care about innocent bystanders but can just go on killing women and children indiscriminately.

## Fight until unbelievers convert

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6924, 6925](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6924)

> …[Muhammad] said: 'I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, ' and whoever said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah', Allah will save his property and his life from me…
