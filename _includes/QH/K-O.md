# The Kaaba {#kaaba}

## The Qiblah {#qiblah}

### The Muslims used to pray toward Jerusalem {#jerusalem-qiblah}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 488](https://sunnah.com/nasai:488)

> "We prayed toward Bait Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) with the Messenger of Allah for sixteen or seventeen months - Safwan was not sure - then it was changed to the Qiblah."

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4486](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4486)

> The Prophet prayed facing Bait-ulMaqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months but **he wished** that his Qibla would be the Kaaba (at Mecca). So Allah Revealed (2.144) and he offered Asr prayers(in his Mosque facing Kaaba at Mecca) and some people prayed with him.

The direction changed only because **he wished that his Qibla would be the Kaaba** and Allah, being [the servant of Muhammad](#allah-serves-muhammad), obliged and changed it.

At first Muhammad told them to pray toward Jerusalem because he wanted to have credibility as an Abrahamic religion alongside Christianity and Judaism. But after being rejected by these in Mecca, he instead changed it toward the pagan temple in Mecca to compromise with the pagan worshipers of Arabia.

## The Black stone {#black-stone}

### The black stone absorbs sins

[Mishkat al-Masabih 2577](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:2577)

> “The black stone descended from paradise whiter than milk, but the sins of the descendants of Adam made it black." 

See also: [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 877](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:877)

### Muhammad touched the black stone

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2946](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2946)

> “The Messenger of Allah did not touch the corners of the Ka’bah apart from the Black Corner (i.e., the corner where the Black Stone is) and the one that is next to it facing the houses of Banu Jumah (i.e., the Yemenite Corner).”

### Kissing the stone is idolatry

[Sahih al-Bukhari 1597](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1597)

> Umar came near the Black Stone and kissed it and said "No doubt, I know that you are a stone and can neither benefit anyone nor harm anyone. Had I not seen Allah's Messenger kissing you I would not have kissed you."

Even Umar recognized that kissing the black stone was a pointless act of idolatry, but he only did so because Muhammad did so.


# Lying

## Three situations in which you can lie

[Sunan Abi Dawud 4921 (Sahih)](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4921)


> I did not hear the Messenger of Allah making a concession for anything people say falsely except in three matters. The Messenger of Allah would say: I do not count as a liar a man who puts things right between people, saying a word by which he intends only putting things right, and a man who says something in war, and a man who says something to his wife, or a wife who says something to her husband.

In Islam you can lie:

1. To promote peace
2. In war
3. In marriage

These pretty much cover all of the human conditions: peaceful, non-peaceful and close relationships. Since Islam is at constant war with the non-Islamic world, a Muslim is always allowed to lie to a non-Muslim. Even Muslims are allowed to lie to one another to preserve peace, which is probably part of why Dawahists lie to Muslims about everything to keep them being Muslims. You can't even trust your spouse, your closest companion. Besides polygamy, child marriage, easy and prolific divorce, and mutah, this is yet another way Islam perverts and destroys the concept of marriage.

In other words, lying is basically permitted at any and all times for any and all reasons to any and all people, which means that you can never trust a Muslim. A religion that sanctions lying can logically not be the truth. It can only come from the Father of Lies, Satan. (John 8:44)

## You can break an oath if you have a better alternative 

[Riyad as-Salihin 1716](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1716)

> The Messenger of Allah said, "When you swear an oath and consider something else to be better than it, make expiation for your oath and do the thing that is better."

Islam is based on lies and dishonesty.






# Minutiae 

Islam really obsesses about completely ridiculous everyday minutiae, as if God would care. Controlling your everyday behavior is a big red flag for a manipulative cult. Here are some of the most ridiculous examples.

## How to breathe while drinking

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3427](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3427) 

> “When anyone of you drinks, let him not breathe into the vessel. If he wants to continue drinking, let him move the vessel away (in order to breathe) then bring it back, if he wants.”

## Don't hold your penis with the right hand

[Sahih Muslim 267a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:267a)

> None of you should hold your penis with his right hand while urinating

## Don't wear only one shoe

[Riyad as-Salihin 1649](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1649)

> None of you should walk wearing one shoe; you should either wear them both or take them off both.

[Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 956](https://sunnah.com/adab:956)

> …"When one of you breaks his sandal-strap, he should not walk in his other sandal until it is mended."

## Don't tie your shoe while standing

[Riyad as-Salihin 1651](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1651)

> The Messenger of Allah forbade a person tying up his shoe while standing


## Don't make pictures

[Riyad as-Salihin 1678](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1678)

> The Messenger of Allah said, "Those who draw pictures will be punished on the Day of Resurrection

[Riyad as-Salihin 1680](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1680)

> I heard the Messenger of Allah saying, "Every painter will go to Hell, and for every portrait he has made, there will be appointed one who will chastise him in the Hell."

## Don't throw pebbles

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3226](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3226)

> The Prophet forbade throwing small pebbles 

## How to do your toilet

[Mishkat al-Masabih 336](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:336)

> God’s messenger forbade us to face the qibla when easing ourselves or passing water, or to wipe ourselves with the right hand, or to wipe ourselves with less than three stones, or to wipe ourselves with dung or bone.











# Muhammad

Things that Muhammad did.

## Muhammad's appearance

What did he look like?

An average looking fellow, neither tall nor short, with wavy hair, silver white skin, yellow beard, eyeliner and mascara, gap tooth and one tooth knocked out.

![Artist's rendition of Muhammad according to Hadiths](https://i.ibb.co/PMb3RRZ/IMG-1912.jpg)

### Muhammad was very average looking {#average-looks}

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3623](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3623)

> The Messenger of Allah was not very tall nor was he [very] short, nor was he pale white, nor was he brown, nor was the wave of his hair completely curly nor straight…

### Muhammad had big hands {#big-hands}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5906](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5906)

> The Prophet had big hands


### Muhammad dyed his beard yellow {#yellow-beard}


[Sunan Ibn Majah 3626](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3626)

> I saw the Messenger of Allah dyeing his beard yellow

### Muhammad had a gap tooth

[Ash-Shama'il Al-Muhammadiyah 15](https://sunnah.com/shamail:15)

> Allah’s Messenger had a gap between the medial pair of teeth. When he spoke, it seemed as if light were emerging from between his middle teeth."

### Muhammad was white 

[Sunan Abu Dawud 4864](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4864)

> Sa’id al-Jariri quoted Abu al-Tufail as saying: I saw the Messenger of Allah. I asked: How did you see him? He said: He was white, good-looking, and when he walked, it looked as if he was descending to a low ground.

[Ash-Shama'il Al-Muhammadiyah 12](https://sunnah.com/shamail:12)

> Abu Huraira … said:
> "Allah’s Messenger … was white, as if he were fashioned from silver, with loosely curled hair."

[Ash-Shama'il Al-Muhammadiyah 14](https://sunnah.com/shamail:14)

> He was white, handsome, of medium size.”

### Muhammad used mascara and eyeliner {#make-up-tips}

[Ash-Shama'il Al-Muhammadiyah 50](https://sunnah.com/shamail:50)

> Ibn 'Abbas reported that the Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): "Color the edges of the eyelids with antimony [ithmid], for it clears the vision and makes the eyelashes grow!” He also maintained that the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) had a kohl jar from which he used to apply kohl to his eyelashes every night, three times in this [eye],and three times in that.

Muhammad ordained that his followers ought to follow his example and use heavy mascara and eyeliner. He retouched his make-up three times a day. Muhammad also gave make-up tips, saying the best brands were made of antimony, saying that [it made his eyes pop like firecrackers!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eRbxsvz1Jnw)

### Muhammad had a tooth knocked out

> The face of the Prophet [was] wounded and one of his front teeth [wa]s broken

### Muhammad dressed in drag

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2581](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2581) tells a story about how people only came with gifts and requesting revelations of Muhammad on the days he was staying in Alisha's house. They did this because they knew Aisha was his favorite wife and perhaps he was in a good mood while he was sexually assaulting his child bride. In any case his other wives complained that Aisha was favoured and wanted people to come with gifts when Muhammad was with them too. But Muhammad explains the reason why people only come to him in Aishas house:

> the revelation does not come to me while I am in the garment of another woman except Aisha.

Allah will not give Muhammad any revelations unless he is cross dressing in Aisha's clothes.

Note that Sunnah.com often adds to and changes translations that are too embarrassing, so they have changed the English translation here to read "beds" rather than "woman's garment". But the Arabic is "لاَ تُؤْذِينِي فِي عَائِشَةَ، فَإِنَّ الْوَحْىَ لَمْ يَأْتِنِي، وَأَنَا فِي ثَوْبِ امْرَأَةٍ إِلاَّ عَائِشَةَ ‏" where the words " ثَوْبِ امْرَأَةٍ" means "women's dress", not "bed". But this kind of deception is to be expected because without lies Islam dies.


Deuteronomy 22:5 says “A woman shall not wear a man’s garment, nor shall a man put on a woman’s cloak, for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD your God."





## Muhammad's character

### Muhammad was a sinner

Surah 40:55; 47:19

> Then have patience (O Muhammad). Lo! the promise of Allah is true. And ask forgiveness of thy sin

[Sahih al-Bukhari 744](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:744)

> Allah's Messenger used to keep silent between the Takbir and the recitation of Qur'an and that interval of silence used to be a short one. I said to the Prophet "May my parents be sacrificed for you! What do you say in the pause between Takbir and recitation?" The Prophet said, "I say, 'O Allah! Set me apart from my sins as the East and West are set apart from each other and clean me from sins as a white garment is cleaned of dirt. O Allah! Wash off my sins with water, snow and hail.'"

[Sahih al Bukhari 6307](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6307)

> I heard Allah's Messenger saying." By Allah! I ask for forgiveness from Allah and turn to Him in repentance more than seventy times a day."

[Sahih al Bukhari 6368](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6368)

> The Prophet used to say, "O Allah! I seek refuge with You … from all kinds of sins … O Allah! Wash away my sins with the water of snow and hail, and cleanse my heart from all the sins as a white garment is cleansed from the filth, and let there be a long distance between me and my sins, as You made East and West far from each other."

### Muhammad randomly beat people for no reason

[Sunan Abi Dawud 4536](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4536)

> When the Messenger of Allah was distributing something, a man came towards him and bent down on him. The Messenger of Allah struck him with a bough and his face was wounded. The Messenger of Allah said to him: Come and take retaliation. He said: no, I have forgiven, Messenger of Allah!.

### Muhammad was a copycat {#copycat}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5917](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5917)

> The Prophet used to copy the people of the Scriptures in matters in which there was no order from Allah.


### Muhammad cursed an orphan girl to die young {#cursed-orphan}

[Sahih Muslim 2603](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2603)

> Anas b. Malik reported that there was an orphan girl with Umm Sulaim (who was the mother of Anas). Allah's Messenger saw that orphan girl and said: O, it is you; you have grown young. May you not advance in years! That slave-girl returned to Umm Sulaim weeping. Umm Sulaim said: O daughter, what is the matter with you? She said: Allah's Apostle has invoked curse upon me that I should not grow in age and thus I would never grow in age…

The Bible says that being kind and help orphans in their need is pure and undefiled worship. (James 1:27) 

Even Surah 93:9 says "so as for the orphan, do not oppress them". But Muhammad curses this orphan girl to die young. A young girl, with no mother or father, who is a slave, this girl already has a tough life and Muhammad decides to break her heart and psychologically traumatize her. When asked why, he smiles and says it doesn't matter because she'll go to paradise when she dies anyway. Sick and twisted.


Exodus 22:22 says "You shall not mistreat any widow or fatherless child."


### Muhammad disdained a blind man

Surah 80:1,2

> The Prophet frowned and turned away when the blind man came to him.

Mark 10:46-42, Luke 18:35-43 and John 9 tells of how Jesus treated blind people. While others may opress them, Jesus calls them to himself and heals them. Muhammad can't heal anyone, but even looks down on the blind with contempt.

Leviticus 19:14 says "You shall not curse the deaf or put a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall fear your God: I am the LORD."


### Muhammad did not like poetry {#philistine}

The Prophet said, "It is better for a man to fill the inside of his body with pus than to fill it with poetry."


### Muhammad didn't practice what he preached {#hypocrite}

[Muhammad said to not pee towards the Qiblah but did so himself](#peeing-qiblah}



### Muhammad almost caused a famine {#caused-famine}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2471](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2471)

> It was narrated from 'Aisha that the Prophet heard some sounds and said: “What is this noise?” They said: “Palm trees that are being pollinated.” He said: “If they did not do that it would be better.” So they did not pollinate them that year, and the dates did not mature properly. they mentioned that to the Prophet and he said: “If it is one of the matters of your religion, then refer to me.”

Muhammad's incompetence caused the harvest to almost fail, yet he had the gall to tell people to consult him.


### Muhammad probably stole a red velvet cloth {#red-velvet}

[Sunan Abi Dawud 3971](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3971)

> Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: The verse "And no Prophet could (ever) be false to his trust" was revealed about a red velvet. When it was found missing on the day of Badr, some people said; Perhaps the Messenger of Allah has taken it. So Allah, the Exalted, sent down "And no prophet could (ever) be false to his trust" to the end of the verse.

After the battle of Badr, the Muslims were dividing up the spoil, and apparently a piece of red velvet cloth was missing. The immediate suspicion of the other Muslim was that Muhammad had stolen it.

You have to wonder why rather than being beyond suspicion, Muhammad was the very first suspect when something was missing?

So to defend himself, ~~Muhammad~~ Allah revealed the verse Surah 3:161:

> It is inconceivable that a prophet would ever dishonestly take something from the battle gains. Anyone who does so will carry it with him on the Day of Resurrection, when each soul will be fully repaid for what it has done: no one will be wronged.

So essentially ~~Muhammad~~ Allah says "No, Muhammad is innocent. Trust me bro." But the same all-knowing Allah was unable to point out who the real thief was? That not only did not solve the problem, but rather makes Muhammad look more suspicious. 

Adding to the mystique is the fact that the verse says "Anyone who does so will carry it with him on the Day of Resurrection, when each soul will be fully repaid for what it has done". Why does the verse say that the thief would carry the red velvet clothing with him until judgment day?

The same person, Abdullah ibn Abbas, who told is of how everyone suspected Muhammed of stealing the red velvet piece of clothing, also tells us this:

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 1048](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:1048)

> Ibn Abbas narrated: "A red velvet cloth was placed in the grave of the Prophet."

I guess Abdullah Ibn Abbas had his suspicions, since he told both stories of how everyone thought Muhammad stole a red velvet cloak, and gives the detail that Muhammad was buried on top of a red velvet cloak. Is it the same cloak? We'll just have to see if Muhammad "will carry it with him on the Day of Resurrection."

Also [Ash-Shama'il Al-Muhammadiyah 3](https://sunnah.com/shamail:3) says Muhammad liked to dress in red, so there's that.

### Muhammad killed puppies

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 4276](https://sunnah.com/nasai:4276)

> the Messenger of Allah commanded that all dogs be killed, even small dogs.


### Muhammad was a tough guy

[Sahih al-Bukhari 36](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:36)

> Had I not found it difficult for my followers, then I would not remain behind any sariya going for Jihad and I would have loved to be martyred in Allah's cause and then made alive, and then martyred and then made alive, and then again martyred in His cause."

Sure, Moe, if it weren't for the people needing their cult leader, you would have jumped right into the fray, over and over, rather than sending others to their death. You're so tough!

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3106](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3106)

> Among the best of the people is a man who strives in the cause of Allah on the back of his horse, or on the back of his camel, or on his own two feet, until death comes to him.

## Killing disbelievers guarantees immunity from hell

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3109](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3109)

> Two will never be gathered together in the Fire: A Muslim who killed a disbeliever then tried his best and did not deviate.

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3116](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3116)

> Anyone whose feet become dusty in the cause of Allah, he will be forbidden to the Fire









## Muhammad used to be a pagan

### Muhammad sacrificed to pagan gods

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5499](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5499)

> Allah's Messenger said that he met Zaid bin Amr Nufail at a place near Baldah and this had happened before Allah's Messenger received the Divine Inspiration. Allah's Messenger presented a dish of meat to Zaid bin Amr, but Zaid refused to eat of it and then said, "I do not eat of what you slaughter on your stonealtars nor do I eat except that on which Allah's Name has been mentioned on slaughtering."

[Zaid ibn Amr Nufayl (died 605) was a monotheist who lived in Mecca shortly before Islam.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zayd_ibn_Amr)  Muhammad had just come back from sacrificing an animal to the pagan idols, and offered some of the meat to Zaid. Zaid refused, saying he would not eat anything sacrificed to false gods.




## Muhammad's family {#muhammads-family}

### Muhammad would not provide more than one garment each to his wives {#miserly-husband}

[Sahih al Bukhari 312](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:312)

> Narrated 'Aisha: None of us had more than a single garment and we used to have our menses while wearing it. Whenever it got soiled with blood of menses we used to apply saliva to the blood spot and rub off the blood with our nails.

When they had menstrual blood stain their garments they would have to clean them with spit.

### A wife of Muhammad used a dish to catch yellow menstrual discharge while praying {#discharge-dish}

[Sahih al Bukhari 310](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:310)

> Narrated 'Aisha: "One of the wives of Allah's Messenger  joined him in I'tikaf and she noticed blood and yellowish discharge (from her private parts) and put a dish under her when she prayed."

### Muhammad daughter Fatima was denied an inheritance {#daughter-no-inheritance}

Instead they had to go to Abu Bakr to get what they needed to survive as a charity.

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 2969](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2969)

> Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin: Fatimah was demanding (the property of) sadaqah of the Messenger of Allah  at Medina and Fadak, and what remained from the fifth of Khaybar. Aisha quoted AbuBakr as saying: The Messenger of Allah  said: We are not inherited; whatever we leave is sadaqah (charity). The family of Muhammad will eat from this property, that is, from the property of Allah. They will not take more then their sustenance.

### The wives of Muhammad were also denied an inheritance. {#wives-no-inheritance}

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 2976](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2976)

> Narrated 'Aishah: When the Messenger of Allah  died, the wives of the Prophet  intended to send 'Uthman b. 'Affan to Abu Bakr to ask him their cost of living from (the inheritance of) the Prophet . Thereupon 'Aishah said: Did not the Messenger of Allah  say: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah (charity).

### The wives of Muhammad were denied remarriage {#no-remarriage}

Surah 33:53

> And it is not right for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever marry his wives after him. This would certainly be a major offence in the sight of Allah.

In the ancient world marriage meant protection for a woman. Being left a widow was very negative. Also being left childless like Aisha was, meant she didn't even have, nor could she ever get children to help her in her old age. Muhammad was really selfish and heartless to leave his wives to fend for themselves just because of his own insecurities.

### The parents of Muhammad are in hell {#parents-in-hell}

[Sahih Muslim 976b](https://sunnah.com/muslim/11/135)

> Abu Huraira reported: The Apostle of Allah  visited the grave of his mother and he wept, and moved others around him to tears, and said: **I sought permission from my Lord to beg forgiveness for her but it was not granted to me**, and I sought permission to visit her grave and it was granted to me so visit the graves, for that makes you mindful of death.

Muhammad was not allowed to ask forgiveness for his mother, meaning Allah will not forgive her, meaning she is in hell.

[Sunan Abu Dawud 4718](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4718)

> Anas said : A man asked : where is my father, Messenger of Allah? He replied! Your father is in Hell. When he turned his back, he said : **My father and your father are in Hell.**

Muhammad's father is in hell.

















## Muhammad and hygiene {#muhammad-hygiene}

### Muhammad told his followers to drink sewer water {#sewer-water}

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 67](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:67)

> Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri: I heard that the people asked the Prophet of Allah : Water is brought for you from the well of Buda'ah. It is a well in which dead dogs, menstrual clothes and excrement of people are thrown. The Messenger of Allah  replied: Verily water is pure and is not defiled by anything...

[Sunnan Ibn Majah 520](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:520)

> "We came to a pond in which there was the carcass of a donkey, so we refrained from using the water until the Messenger of Allah came to us and said: 'Water is not made impure by anything.' Then we drank from it and gave it to our animals to drink, and we carried some with us."

To say that water is not defiled by anything, not even the rotting corpses of dogs and donkeys, menstrual waste products and literal feces is insane and unscientific. This unhygienic idea has probably cost the lives of untold numbers of people throughout history.

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 328](https://sunnah.com/nasai:328)

> The Messenger of Allah was asked about water and how some animals and carnivorous beasts might drink from it. He said: 'If the water is more than two Qullahs (ca 200 liters), it will not become filthy.'

### Muhammad gargled with dick water {#dick-water}

[Sahih al Bukhari 274](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:274)

> Water was placed for the ablution of Allah's Messenger after Janaba. He poured water with his right hand over his left twice or thrice and then washed his private parts and rubbed his hand on the earth or on a wall twice or thrice and then rinsed his mouth, washed his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out...

Notice that after washing his private parts he uses the same water to rinse his mouth and nose.

[Sahih al Bukhari 4206](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4206)

He said, "This was inflicted on me on the day of Khaibar and the people said, 'Salama has been wounded.' Then I went to the Prophet  and he puffed his saliva in the wound thrice., and since then I have not had any pain in it till this hour."

### Muhammad believed spit mixed with dirt could cure illnesses {#spit-and-dirt}

[Sahih al Bukhari 5745](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5745)

> Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet  used to say to the patient, "In the Name of Allah The earth of our land and the saliva of some of us cure our patient."

### Muhammad tried to heal himself by blowing raspberries {#blowing-raspberries}

[Mishkat al-Masabih 1532](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:1532)

> She said that when the Prophet had a complaint he would blow on himself, ejecting saliva, reciting the Mu'awwidhah, and wipe himself with his hand. She said, “When he suffered from the pain of which he died, I would blow on him ejecting saliva and recite the Mu'awwidhat as he did, and would take the Prophet’s hand to wipe him.”  

### Muhammad spat in the mouth of a newborn child {#spitting-in-mouth-of-child}

[Sahih al Bukhari 5469](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5469)

> I conceived 'Abdullah bin AzZubair at Mecca and went out (of Mecca) while I was about to give birth. I came to Medina and encamped at Quba', and gave birth at Quba'. Then I brought the child to Allah's Messenger  and placed it (on his lap). He asked for a date, chewed it, and put his saliva in the mouth of the child. So the first thing to enter its stomach was the saliva of Allah's Messenger

[Sahih Muslim 2773a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2773a)

> Jabir reported Allah's Apostle  came to the grave of 'Abdullah b. Ubayy, brought him out from that, placed him on his knee and put his saliva in his mouth and shrouded him in his own shirt and Allah knows best.

### Muhammad spat on his prayer mat

[Sunan Abi Dawud 484](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:484)

> AbuSa'id said: I saw Wathilah ibn al-Asqa' in the mosque of Damascus. He spat at the mat and then rubbed it with his foot. He was asked: Why did you do so? He said: Because I saw the Messenger of Allah doing so.

### Muhammad urinated squatting

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 29](https://sunnah.com/nasai:29)

> Whoever tells you that the Messenger of Allah urinated standing up, do not believe him, for he would not urinate except while squatting."

### Muhammad urinated standing

[Sahih al Bukhari 2471](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2471)

> Narrated Hudhaifa: I saw Allah's Messenger coming to the dumps of some people and urinated there while standing.

It seems that Hudhaifa [contradicts Aisha](#muhammad-urinated-squatting) and that [Muhammad didn't practice what he taught](#no-urinating-standing) and [other Hadiths also contradict.](#muhammad-urinated-standing)

### Muhammad urinated in some weird way

[Sunan Ibn Majah 341](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:341)

> It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said: "The Messenger of Allah turned towards a mountain pass and urinated, until I took pity on him because of the way he parted his legs when he urinated."

Why do Muslims consider such information important for their religion?

### Muhammad peed toward the Qiblah {peeing-qiblah}

Note: [The Qiblah]{#qiblah} is the prayer direction towards the [Kaaba.](#kaaba)

[Sunnan Ibn Majah 325](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:325)

> "The Messenger of Allah forbade facing the Qiblah when urinating. But I saw him, one year before he died, facing the Qiblah (while urinating)."

### Muhammad pooped facing the Qiblah {#poop-qiblah}

Note: [The Qiblah]{#qiblah} is the prayer direction towards the [Kaaba.](#kaaba)

[Sunan Ibn Majah 323](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:323)

> It was narrated that Ibn 'Umar said: "I saw the Messenger of Allah in his toilet, facing towards the Qiblah."

[Sunan Ibn Majah 324](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:324)

> He (Muhammad) said: '... Turn my seat in the toilet to face the Qiblah.'"


### Muhammad told people to drink camel urine {#drinking-camel-urine}

[Mishkat al-Masabih 3539](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:3539)

> Anas told that some people of ‘Ukl who had come to the Prophet and accepted Islam found Medina unhealthy, so he ordered them to go to the camels of the sadaqa and drink some of their urine...

[He later tortured these people to death.](#tortured-to-death)

### Muhammad wore semen encrusted clothes {#semen-clothes}

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 372](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:372)

> I used to rub off the semen from the clothes of the Messenger of Allah. He would would pray in it.

> Incase I (Aisha) found that (semen) on the garment of the Messenger of Allah dried up, I scraped it off with my nails.

I can imagine this poor girl walking after this old man, rubbing dried up semen stains out of his clothes with her finger nail while he's on his way to the mosque.

## Muhammad's mental health {#mental-health}

### Muhammad was delusional

[Sahih Al Bukhari 3268](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3268)

> Magic was worked on the Prophet so that he began to fancy that he was doing a thing which he was not actually doing. One day he invoked (Allah) for a long period and then said, "I feel that Allah has inspired me as how to cure myself. Two persons came to me (in my dream) and sat, one by my head and the other by my feet. One of them asked the other, "What is the ailment of this man?" The other replied, 'He has been bewitched"...

[Sahih Al Bukhari 5765 provides more detail:](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5765)

> Magic was worked on Allah's Messenger  so that he used to think that he had sexual relations with his wives while he actually had not...

### Muhammad was suicidal {#suicidal}

[Sahih al Bukhari 91](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/91)

> …the Prophet  became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear before him and say, "O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah's Messenger  in truth" whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he had said before.

### Muhammad was paranoid, accusing a child of being a supervillain {#dajjal}

The Dajjal is an evil figure in Islamic eschatology who will pretend to be the promised Messiah and later claim to be God, appearing before the Day of Judgment according to the Islamic eschatological narrative. Muhammad harassed, stalked, and spread rumors about a young boy, saying he was this Dajjal, making him depressed and suicidal.

[Sahih Muslim 2930 a, 2931, 169 d](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2930a)

> [Muhammad went] to Ibn Sayyad … he found him playing with children … Allah's Messenger struck his back with his hands. Allah's Messenger said: Ibn Sayyad, don't you bear witness that I am the messenger of Allah? Ibn Sayyad looked toward him and he said: I bear witness to the fact that you [are] the messenger of the unlettered. … 'Umar b. Khattab said: Allah's Messenger, permit me that I should [behead him]. Thereupon Allah's Messenger said: If he is the same (Dajjal) who would appear near the Last Hour, you would not be able to overpower him, and if he is not that there is no good for you to kill him. 

There was some back and forth banter. But since this boy didn't play along with Muhammad's delusions, Muhammad insinuated that he is the Dajjal.

> after some time Allah's Messenger … went towards the palm trees where Ibn Sayyad was. When [he] went near the tree he hid himself behind a tree with the intention of hearing something from Ibn sayyad before Ibn Sayyad could see him, but Allah's Messenger saw him on a bed with a blanket around him … and Ibn Sayyad's mother saw Allah's Messenger behind the trunk of the palm tree. She said … here is Muhammad. Thereupon Ibn Sayyad jumped up …

So Muhammed is actually stalking a sleeping young boy, trying to eavesdrop to confirm his suspicion that this boy is a supervillain.

> then [Muhammad] made a mention of the Dajjal and said: …(the Dajjal) is one-eyed and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is not one-eyed.…

It would appear that perhaps Ibn Saiyad was one-eyed, because suddenly Muhammad starts spreading a rumour that the Dajjal is one-eyes, and for the rest of his life, Ibn Saiyad had to live with this rumour. Because of this, the boy grew up to be depressed and suicidal.

[Sahih Muslim 2927c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2927c)

> …lbn Saiyad was along with us. … I felt terribly frightend from him as it was said about him that he was the Dajjal. He brought his goods and placed them by my luggage and I said: It is intense heat. Would you not place that under that tree? And he did that. Then there appeared before us a flock of sheep. He went and brought a cup of milk and said: Abu Said, drink that. I said it is intense heat and the milk is also hot (whereas the fact was) that I did not like to drink from his hands or to take it from his hand and he said: Abu Said, I think that I should take a rope and suspend it by the tree and then commit suicide because of the talks of the people…

Abu Said, like most people, were afraid of Ibn Saiyad because of the rumor started by Muhammad, so he tried to avoid him. Ibn Saiyad, having been ostracized like that his whole life said that it made him want to hang himself.

### Muhammad was posessed by Satan {#posessed-by-satan}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3960](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3960)

> I said: "Don't you have a Shaitan?" He said: "Yes, but Allah helped me with him, so he submitted."

### Muhammad believed he had a wrestling match with Satan {#wrestling-satan}

[Sahih al Bukhari 1210](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1210)

> Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, "Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. Then I remembered the statement of Prophet Solomon, 'My Lord ! Bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.' Then Allah made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated)."

### Muhammad was commanded by jinns

[Sahih Muslim 2814 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2814a)

> Allah's Messenger said: There is none amongst you with whom is not an attache from amongst the jinn (devil). They (the Companions) said: Allah's Messenger, with you too? Thereupon he said: Yes, but Allah helps me against him and so I am safe from his hand and **he does not command me but for good.**

Even if Satan only commands Muhammad for good, it still means Muhammad is commanded by Satan.







## Muhammad's miracles {#muhammads-miracles}

### Muhammad did NOT perform miracles {#no-miracles}

Surah 6:109

> And they swore by Allah their most solemn oaths that if a sign were to come to them, they would believe in it. Say, “Signs are only with Allah,” but how do you know that even if it did come, they would still not believe?

Surah 17:59

> And nothing prevented Us from sending miraculous signs except that the ancients disbelieved in them. ….


People didn't believe Muhammad was a prophet because true prophets of God were accompanied by signs and miracles. They asked for a sign, any signs, and swore that if they got it they would believe, but Allah/Muhammad gives the excuse that they would not believe anyway.

Also:

- Surah 6:37
- Surah 13:7
- Surah 20:20

### Muhammad DID perform miracles {#did-miracles}

[Sahih al Bukhari 3637](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3637)

> …The Meccan people requested Allah's Messenger to show them a miracle, and so he showed them the splitting of the moon.

So which is it? Muhammad never did any miracles, or Muhammad did miracles? This is a [contradiction](#contradictions).









## Muhammad and sex

### Mohammed was a pedophile {#child-sexual-abuse}

[Sunan an Nasa'i 3378](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3378)

> "The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls."

[Sahih al Bukhari 6130](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130)

> Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger  used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was **a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.**) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)

Aisha, the favorite wife of Muhammad, was 6 years old when Muhammad married her, and he had sex with their when she was only 9 years old. She was prepubescent, still playing with dolls together with her playmates. Dolls are usually forbidden but we're allowed for Aisha since she was a "little girl" so young that normal Islamic rules didn't yet apply to her.

### Muhammed used to put his face into Aishas crotch and recite Quran verses when she was menstruating {#crotch-talk}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 634](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:634)

> …'Aishah said: "The Messenger of Allah used to put his head in my lap when I was menstruating and recite Qur'an."

### Muhammad used to fondle Aisha when she was menstruating {#fondling-aisha}

[Sahih al Bukhari 299](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:299)

> Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet  and I used to take a bath from a single pot while we were Junub. During the menses, he used to order me to put on an Izar (dress worn below the waist) and used to fondle me. …

### Muhammad used to suck on Aishas tongue

[Sunan Abi Dawud 2386](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2386)

> Narrated Aisha, [Mother of the believers]: The Prophet used to kiss her and suck her tongue when he was fasting.

Consenting adults sucking each others tongues is none of my business, but why the obsession about telling such embarrasing details to the world? And since Aisha was technically a child during their entire marriage, this is disgusting.  

### Muhammad French-kissed a little boy

[Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 1183](https://sunnah.com/adab:1183)

> …Then he said, 'Where is the little one? Call the little one to me.' Hasan came running and jumped into his lap. Then he put his hand in his beard. Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, opened his mouth and put his mouth in his mouth. Then he said, O Allah, I love him, so love him and the one who loves him!'"

### Muhammad was baffled that other men were not pedophiles like him

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5080](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5080)

> Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: When I got married, Allah's Messenger said to me, "What type of lady have you married?" I replied, "I have married a matron' He said, "Why, don't you have a liking for the virgins and for fondling them?" Jabir also said: Allah's Messenger said, "Why didn't you marry a young girl so that you might play with her and she with you?'

The fact that other men are not drawn to sexually abuse children makes Muhammad flabbergasted.


### Muhammad believed a woman's silence means consent {#silence-is-consent}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5137](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5137)

> Narrated Aisha: I said, "O Allah's Messenger! A virgin feels shy." He said, "Her consent is (expressed by) her silence."

A true rape culture.

### Muhammad was "ridden" by tall black men all night long {#ridden}

[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal 3778](https://www-islamweb-net.translate.goog/ar/library/content/6/3599/%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%A8%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%B1%D8%B6%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%87?_x_tr_sl=ar&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp), [3688](https://hadithportal-com.translate.goog/index.php?show=hadith&h_id=3688&book=35&_x_tr_sl=ar&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp) (Google translate), [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2861](https://sunnah.com/urn/730940)

These 3 hadiths mentions a weird story of a night excursion Muhammad took with a certain Abdullah ibn Masoud. They provide different complementary details, so I piece together the gist of the story with quotations from all 3.

So Muhammad and Abdullah go to the valley of Makkah. Muhammad draws a circle in the sand and tells Abdullah to stay inside of it, otherwise he will perish. Apparently Muhammad is expecting visitors. Abdullah obliges, but Muhammad goes outside the circle.

Along comes some men about whom Abdullah says:

> some men came to me that appeared as if they were from Az-Zut (A dark people, either from North Africa or India.), both their hair and their bodies. 

Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal 3778 provides this information:

> they have no clothes on them
> They were long

So some long, naked, seemingly North African men comes along. Then what happened?

> He said, “So they came and **started riding the Messenger of God**.” He said, “And the Prophet of God, recited to them.”

So a bunch of naked North African men meet up with Muhammad and "started riding" him? Meanwhile Muhammad is reciting Quran verses to them?

> When the pillar of dawn split, they started to go

When dawn breaks they stop "riding" Muhammad and leaves. 

> Then the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, came **with heavy pain...from what they had ridden on.**

Muhammad stumbles back to Abdullah with heavy pain from being ridden all night by long, naked North African men?

> He said, “I find myself heavy,” … Then the Messenger of God, placed his head in my lap… 

Poor Muhammed has been ridden so hard by the long, naked North African men that he was in pain and exhausted, falling asleep in the lap of Abdullah.

> And the Messenger of Allah would snore when he slept. So while I was sitting there, and the Messenger of Allah was sleeping (with his head resting) on my thigh, there appeared some men wearing white garments, and Allah knows best just how handsome they were.

Then some other men shows up. They wear white and are apparently very handsome.

> Then they said to each other: 'We have not ever seen a slave (of Allah) who was given the likes of what this Prophet has been given.

I say... Muhammad "was given" good that night...

The white clad men starts pronouncing a parable over Muhammad while he is sleeping. Then they leave. Muhammad wakes up, declares that they were angels, and explains their parable.

But who were the long, naked, North African men who rode Muhammad all night long so that he became sore and exhausted? 

### Muhammad was kissing and cuddling with a man

[Sunan Abu Dawud 3476](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3476)

Sunnah.com tries to fudge the wording but the Arabic says:

> قَالَتِ اسْتَأْذَنَ أَبِي النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَدَخَلَ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ قَمِيصِهِ فَجَعَلَ يُقَبِّلُ وَيَلْتَزِمُ

Which translates as:

> She said: My father asked permission from the Prophet, … and he came between him and his shirt and began to kiss and cuddle.


### Muhammad ordered his followers to bite their father's penis

[Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 963 (Sahih)](https://sunnah.com/adab:963)

>  I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Whomever attributes himself (in lineage) with an attribution of Jahiliyyah, then tell him to bite his father's male organ and do not speak figuratively (i.e. be explicit)." ' "








## Muhammad and slavery {#muhammad-slavery}

See also [Slavery](#slavery)

### Muhammad owned slaves {#slave-owner}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5433](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5433)

> Allah's Messenger went to his slave tailor...

[Muwatta Malik book 21 hadith 25](https://sunnah.com/urn/509860)

> Rifaa ibn Zayd presented a black slave boy to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, whose name was Midam...Midam was unsaddling the camel of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when a stray arrow struck and killed him. The people said, 'Good luck to him! The Garden!' The Messenger of Allah said, 'No! By He in whose hand my self is! The cloak which he took from the spoils on the Day of Khaybar before they were distributed will blaze with fire on him.'

Muhammad had a black slave who was killed in battle, and Muhammad said he went to hell.

### Muhammad had a sex slave (#muhammads-sex-slave)

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3959](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3959)

> It was narrated from Anas, that the Messenger of Allah had a female slave with whom he had intercourse, but 'Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: "O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.' until the end of the Verse.

The verse revealed was Surah 66:1-6. [Tafsir al-Jalalayn](http://web.archive.org/web/20220221075859/https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&tTafsirNo=74&tSoraNo=66&tAyahNo=1&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2) says about Surah 66:1-6:

> O Prophet! Why do you prohibit what God has made lawful for you in terms of your Coptic handmaiden Māriya — when he lay with her in the house of Hafsa who had been away but who upon returning and finding out became upset by the fact that this had taken place in her own house and on her own bed — by saying ‘She is unlawful for me!’ seeking by making her unlawful for you to please your wives? And God is Forgiving Merciful having forgiven you this prohibition.

Muhammad was having sex with his sex slave Maria the Copt in the house of his wife Hansa, and quite understandably his wives complained. But then Allah [conveniently revealed](#convenient-revelation) Surah 66:1-6, that Muhammad can do that if he wishes, and if his wives complain, he should divorce them and they can literally go to hell. What a guy!



See [Muhammad and sex](#muhammad-and-sex), [Rape](#rape), [Sex slaves](#sex-slaves).

### Muhammad sold slaves {#slave-trader}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2534](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2534)

> Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: A man amongst us declared that his slave would be freed after his death. The Prophet called for that slave and sold him. The slave died the same year.

[Sahih Muslim 1602](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1602)

> Jabir … reported: There came a slave and pledged allegiance to Allah's Apostle on migration; [who] did not know that he was a slave. Then there came his master and demanded him back, whereupon Allah's Apostle said: Sell him to me. And he bought him for two black slaves…

It seems the exchange rate is two black slaves for one Muslim slave.

This is from chapter 23 which heading  reads:

> Chapter 23: The permissibility of **selling animals for animals of the same kind and of different quality**

### Muhammad personally stoned a woman {#muhammad-stoned-woman}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2555](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2555)

> a woman came to the Prophet and confessed to committing fornication. He issued orders, and her garments were tightened around her (so that her private parts would not become uncovered) then he stoned her, then he offered the funeral prayer for her.

In contrast Jesus defended a woman against being stoned for adultery. (John 8:1-11)


### Muhammad was a terrorist {#muhammad-terrorist}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2977](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2977)

> ...I have been made victorious with terror cast in the hearts of the enemy...


### Muhammad tortured people to death {#muhammad-tortured}

[Mishkat al-Masabih 3539](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:3539)

> … So he sent people in pursuit of them, and when they were brought he had their hands and feet cut off and their eyes put out and left them to die without cauterising them to stop the flow of blood. A version says nails were driven into their eyes. Another says he ordered nails to be heated and after having them blinded with them he had them thrown out on the harra, and although they begged for water they were left to die without being given any.

These people had stolen some camels so Muhammad **had their hands and feet cut off and their eyes put out** with white hot nails, and then left them to die from thirst and bleeding out.



### Muhammad killed children who had pubic hairs {#muhammad-killed-children}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 4981](https://sunnah.com/nasai:4981)

> It was narrated that 'Atiyyah said: 'I was among the prisoners of Quraizah; we were examined, and whoever had grown (pubic) hair was killed, and whoever had not grown hair, he was allowed to live and was not killed."













## Other things about Muhammad 



### Muhammad is equal to Allah in authority

Surah 33:36

> When God and His Messenger have decided on a matter that concerns them, it is not fitting for any believing man or woman to claim freedom of choice in that matter: whoever disobeys God and His Messenger is far astray.

Notice that Allah and Muhammad decide on things **together**, and the are equal in authority.

### Muhammad died a pauper

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3596](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3596)

> "I heard 'Amr bin Al-Harith say: 'I saw the Messenger of Allah and he left nothing behind except his white mule, his weapon and some land which he left as a charity.'"

### Muhammad was worshipped by his contemporaries {#mohammad-worship}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 1627](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1627)

At the funeral of Muhammad:

> Then Abu Bakr stood up, ascended the pulpit and said: ‘Whoever used to worship Allah, Allah is alive and will never die. Whoever **used to worship Muhammad**, Muhammad is dead.

Abu Bakr was telling the Muslims who **used to worship Muhammad** to not do so anymore.


### Muhammad was the first Muslim {#first-muslim}

Surah 6:14

> Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Will I take any guardian other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who provides for all and is not in need of provision?” Say, “**I have been commanded to be the first to submit** and not be one of the polytheists.”

### Allah considered Muhammad the perfect example {#perfect-example}

Surah 33:21

> Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for whoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah often.

[Quran 68:4](https://quran.com/68/4)

> And you are truly a man of outstanding character.







## The death of Muhammad {#death-of-muhammad}

### How did Muhammad die?

#### Allah promises to cut off his aorta if he tells a lie {#cutting-aorta}

[Quran 69:44-47](https://quran.com/69/44-47)

> Had the Messenger made up something in Our Name, We would have certainly seized him by his right hand, then severed his aorta, and none of you could have shielded him ˹from Us˺!

[Musnad Ahmad 107](https://sunnah.com/ahmad:107)

> And if he (Muhammad ﷺ) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah). We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), And then **We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta)**, And none of you could have withheld Us from (punishing) him...”

So Allah promises that Muhammed ever acts as a false prophet, Allah will cut off his aorta.

#### Muhammad eats a poisoned lamb {#poisoned-lamb}

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 4512](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4512)

> Narrated Abu Hurairah: ...So a Jewess presented him at Khaybar with a roasted sheep which she had poisoned. The Messenger of Allah  ate of it and the people also ate. He then said: Take away your hands (from the food), for it has informed me that it is poisoned. Bishr ibn al-Bara' ibn Ma'rur al-Ansari died. So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess (and said to her): What motivated you to do the work you have done? She said: If you were a prophet, it would not harm you; but if you were a king, I should rid the people of you. The Messenger of Allah  then ordered regarding her and she was killed. He then said about the pain of which he died: I continued to feel pain from the morsel which I had eaten at Khaybar. This is the time when **it has cut off my aorta.**

- [Sunnah Abu Dawud 4510](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4510)

After Muhammad kills the whole male Jewish population of Khaibar, a Jewish woman offers him roasted lamb. Being arguably the dumbest person in history, Muhammad accepts it. And it turns out that it was poisoned. Some of his men died, but Muhammad was affected for a long time from the lingering poison. Notice that Muhammad is saying that the pain from the poison feels like it is cutting off his aorta.

#### Muhammad dies from having his aorta cut {#muhammad-dies}

[Sahih al Bukhari 4428](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4428)
  
> Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet  in his ailment in which he died, used to say, "O `Aisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, **I feel as if my aorta is being cut** from that poison."

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 4513](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4513)

> ...I do not think about the illness of my son except the poisoned sheep of which he had eaten with you at Khaybar. The Prophet  said: And I do not think about my illness except that. **This is the time when it cut off my aorta**...

Muhammad eventually died from the poisoned lamb of a jewish woman, and he did so while complaining that he felt as if his aorta was being cut. This is exactly how Allah said he would die if he was a false prophet.

Notice also the poetic biblical references in that a false anti-christ prophet was killed by Allah after eating of the Lamb that came from a Jewish woman.

### What was the last orders of Muhammad to his followers? {#last-orders}

[Sahih al Bukhari 3053](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3053)

> Ibn 'Abbas said... The Prophet on his death-bed, gave three orders saying, "Expel the pagans from the Arabian Peninsula, respect and give gifts to the foreign delegates as you have seen me dealing with them." I forgot the third (order)"...

What was that, Ibn Abbas? The last order of Muhammad wasn't noteworthy enough to even commit to memory? But hey, at least you remembered the part about genocide, huh?

### What was the last words of Muhammad? {#last-words}

While Jesus used his last moments to forgive his enemies, Muhammad used his last moments to curse one third of the world population.

[Sahih Muslim 531](https://sunnah.com/muslim:531)

>  'A'isha and Abdullah reported: As the Messenger of Allah  was about to breathe his last, he drew his sheet upon his face and when he felt uneasy, he uncovered his face and said in that very state: Let there be curse upon the Jews and the Christians that they have taken the graves of their apostles as places of worship. He in fact warned (his men) against what they (the Jews and the Christians) did.

### What was the last action of Muhammad? {#last-actions}

Sharing a toothbrush with two other people.

[Sahih al Bukhari 4450](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4450)

> Aisha added, "The Prophet  expired on the day of my turn in my house and he was taken unto Allah while his head was against my chest and his saliva mixed with my saliva." 'Aisha added, "Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr came in, carrying a Siwak he was cleaning his teeth with. Allah's Messenger  looked at it and I said to him, 'O 'AbdurRahman! Give me this Siwak.' So he gave it to me and I cut it, chewed it (it's end) and gave it to Allah's Messenger  who cleaned his teeth with it while he was resting against my chest."
