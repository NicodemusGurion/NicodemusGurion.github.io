# The Kaaba {#kaaba}

## The Qiblah {#qiblah}

### The Muslims used to pray toward Jerusalem {#jerusalem-qiblah}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 488](https://sunnah.com/nasai:488)

> "We prayed toward Bait Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) with the Messenger of Allah for sixteen or seventeen months - Safwan was not sure - then it was changed to the Qiblah."

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4486](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4486)

> The Prophet prayed facing Bait-ulMaqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months but **he wished** that his Qibla would be the Kaaba (at Mecca). So Allah Revealed (2.144) and he offered Asr prayers(in his Mosque facing Kaaba at Mecca) and some people prayed with him.

The direction changed only because **he wished that his Qibla would be the Kaaba** and Allah, being [the servant of Muhammad](#allah-serves-muhammad), obliged and changed it.

At first Muhammad told them to pray toward Jerusalem because he wanted to have credibility as an Abrahamic religion alongside Christianity and Judaism. But after being rejected by these in Mecca, he instead changed it toward the pagan temple in Mecca to compromise with the pagan worshipers of Arabia.

## The Black stone {#black-stone}

### The black stone absorbs sins

[Mishkat al-Masabih 2577](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:2577)

> “The black stone descended from paradise whiter than milk, but the sins of the descendants of Adam made it black." 

See also: [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 877](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:877)

### Muhammad touched the black stone

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2946](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2946)

> “The Messenger of Allah did not touch the corners of the Ka’bah apart from the Black Corner (i.e., the corner where the Black Stone is) and the one that is next to it facing the houses of Banu Jumah (i.e., the Yemenite Corner).”

### Kissing the stone is idolatry

[Sahih al-Bukhari 1597](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1597)

> Umar came near the Black Stone and kissed it and said "No doubt, I know that you are a stone and can neither benefit anyone nor harm anyone. Had I not seen Allah's Messenger kissing you I would not have kissed you."

Even Umar recognized that kissing the black stone was a pointless act of idolatry, but he only did so because Muhammad did so.


# Lying

## Three situations in which you can lie

[Sunan Abi Dawud 4921 (Sahih)](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4921)


> I did not hear the Messenger of Allah making a concession for anything people say falsely except in three matters. The Messenger of Allah would say: I do not count as a liar a man who puts things right between people, saying a word by which he intends only putting things right, and a man who says something in war, and a man who says something to his wife, or a wife who says something to her husband.

In Islam you can lie:

1. To promote peace
2. In war
3. In marriage

These pretty much cover all of the human conditions: peaceful, non-peaceful and close relationships. Since Islam is at constant war with the non-Islamic world, a Muslim is always allowed to lie to a non-Muslim. Even Muslims are allowed to lie to one another to preserve peace, which is probably part of why Dawahists lie to Muslims about everything to keep them being Muslims. You can't even trust your spouse, your closest companion. Besides polygamy, child marriage, easy and prolific divorce, and mutah, this is yet another way Islam perverts and destroys the concept of marriage.

In other words, lying is basically permitted at any and all times for any and all reasons to any and all people, which means that you can never trust a Muslim. A religion that sanctions lying can logically not be the truth. It can only come from the Father of Lies, Satan. (John 8:44)

## You can break an oath if you have a better alternative 

[Riyad as-Salihin 1716](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1716)

> The Messenger of Allah said, "When you swear an oath and consider something else to be better than it, make expiation for your oath and do the thing that is better."

Islam is based on lies and dishonesty.






# Minutiae 

Islam really obsesses about completely ridiculous everyday minutiae, as if God would care. Controlling your everyday behavior is a big red flag for a manipulative cult. Here are some of the most ridiculous examples.

## How to breathe while drinking

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3427](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3427) 

> “When anyone of you drinks, let him not breathe into the vessel. If he wants to continue drinking, let him move the vessel away (in order to breathe) then bring it back, if he wants.”

## Don't throw pebbles

> The Prophet forbade throwing small pebbles 

## How to do your toilet
