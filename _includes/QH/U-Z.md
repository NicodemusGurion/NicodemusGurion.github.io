# Violence

See also [Jihad](#jihad), [Muhammad and violence](#muhammad-and-violence), [Rape](#rape).

## Allah likes terrorists more than peaceful Muslims 

Surah 4:95

>  Those believers who stay at home—except those with valid excuses1—are not equal to those who strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives.…

## Fighting is obligatory 

Surah 2:216

> Fighting has been made obligatory upon you ˹believers˺, though you dislike it. Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know.

Apparently Allah thinks violence is good for humans. 

## Not fighting for Islam is punished with hell

Surah 8:15-16

> O believers! When you face the disbelievers in battle, never turn your backs to them. And whoever does so on such an occasion—unless it is a manoeuvre or to join their own troops—will earn the displeasure of Allah, and their home will be Hell. What an evil destination!

A Muslim who chickens out and turns his back on a disbeliever will go to hell.

## The penalty for resisting Islam

Surah 5:33

> Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land**. This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.

In case you wage war against Islam, for example by exposing what a horrible ideology it is, your punishment is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land** and then to burn in hell for all eternity.


## Terrorizing and killing unbelievers

Surah 3:151-152

> We will **throw terror into the hearts** of those who have denied because they associated with Allah (partners) for which He bestowed from on high no authority. And their shelter is the Fire, and how miserable is the dwelling of the unjust! And very truly Allah fulfilled His promise to you **as you killed them** by His permission, until when you faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter and disobeyed after He had shown you what you love: …

Allah will use **terror** against unbelievers. By what method? By Muslims **killing them by His permission**. And then Allah will burn them in **the Fire** forever. But is this a coincidence? No, if a Muslims had a shred of humanity and **faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter** whether terrorism is good, Allah sees that as them having **disobeyed** him.

## "Kill unbelievers wherever you find them"

Surah 4:89

> They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you may all be alike. So do not take them as allies unless they emigrate in the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take any of them as allies or helpers,

Do not befriend unbelievers but **seize them and kill them wherever you find them**.

Surah 4:91

> You will find others who wish to be safe from you and their own people. Yet they cannot resist the temptation ˹of disbelief or hostility˺. If they do not keep away, offer you peace, or refrain from attacking you, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. We have given you full permission over such people.

If someone just wants to **be safe from** Islam and just want to live their life in peace and not be bothered, then **seize them and kill them** too.

## Behead enemies

[Quran 47:4](https://quran.com/47/4?translations=149)

> Thus, when you encounter those who have denied, strike at their necks. Then when you have subjugated them, bind them firmly…

## Behead unbelievers

Surah 8:12

> … I will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers. So strike their necks and strike their fingertips.”

Ever wondered why Islamic terrorists behead their victims? It's by the book.


## Plundering is ok if no one is watching

[Sahih al Bukhari 6772](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6772)

> … when a robber robs and the people look at him, then he is not a believer at the time of doing it.…

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3936](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3936)

> …the plunderer, at the time he is plundering with the people looking on, is not a believer.

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3935](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3935)

> “Whoever plunders openly is not one of us.”

So plundering only makes a Muslim a nonbeliever under the condition that they do it openly when someone is watching. If it's done in secret it's no problem.









# Weird or miscellaneous 

## "The eyes are the leather strap of the anus"

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 203](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:203)

> The Messenger of Allah  said: The eyes are the leather strap of the anus, so one who sleeps should perform ablution.

## Instructions on sandal straps

[Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 956](https://sunnah.com/adab:956)

> …"When one of you breaks his sandal-strap, he should not walk in his other sandal until it is mended."

## Moses had his clothes stolen by a stone

[Sahih al Bukhari 278](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:278)

> ...once Moses went out to take a bath and put his clothes over a stone and then that stone ran away with his clothes. Moses followed that stone saying, "My clothes, O stone! My clothes, O stone!...

## Unbelievers visiting a mosque will go to hell

Surah 9:17-18

> Never was it befitting for the polytheists to attend Allah’s mosques while professing their denial. Those—their deeds were nullified, and in the Fire they abide.Surely, Allah’s mosques can only be attended by one who has attained faith in Allah…

## Muslims living abroad goes to hell

Surah 4:97

> When the angels seize the souls of those who have wronged themselves — scolding them, “What was wrong with you?” they will reply, “We were oppressed in the land.” The angels will respond, “Was Allah’s earth not spacious enough for you to emigrate?” It is they who will have Hell as their home—what an evil destination!

When muslims who live outside of Islamic countries (i.e. them being **opressed in the land**) die, the angel of death will scold them for not living in an Islamic country (i.e. **Allah’s earth**), and send them to hell.

## Snakes in houses may be demons who converted to islam {#snake-jinn}

This teaching is spread out over many Hadiths, but pieced together the gist is: 

Muhammad said that you should kill snakes outside, but if you find a snake inside your house you shouldn't kill it right away. The story goes that a young man found a snake in his house and pierced it with his spear, but it attacked and killed him. People asked Muhammad to pray that he be resurrected but he said that snakes found in houses are jinns (demons) and that some jinns have accepted Islam and become Muslims. So if you find a snake in your house it could be a fellow Muslim, and therefore you should command it to not hurt you but to leave for three days. If it doesn't obey by the fourth day, it's a devil and you should kill it.

## A deathbed convert couldn't be buried

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3930](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3930)

> …[In battle, a] man … attacked an idolator man with a spear, and when he was defeated he said: “I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, I am a Muslim.” But he stabbed him and killed him…We buried him, but the following morning he was on the surface of the earth. They said: “Perhaps an enemy of his disinterred him.” So we buried him (again) and told our slaves to stand guard. But the following morning he was on the surface of the earth again then we said: ‘Perhaps the slaves dozed off.’ So we buried him (again) and stood guard ourselves, but the following morning he was on the surface of the earth (again). So we threw him into one of these mountain passes.’”

Apparently it was impossible to keep this deathbed convert in the ground, so they did the only sensible thing and **threw him into one of these mountain passes**. As you do.









# Women

## Wife beating allowed {#domestic-abuse}

Surah 4:34

> Men stand caretakers of women since Allah has made some of them excel the others, and because they have spent of their wealth., So, the righteous women are obedient, guarding in absence with the protection given by Allah. As for women whose disobedience you fear, convince them, and leave them apart in beds, and **beat them**. Then, if they obey you, do not seek a way against them. Surely, Allah is the Highest, the Greatest.

This is if a man even only fears his wife would be disobedient.

## Never ask why a man beats his wife  {#dont-question-wife-beater}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 1986](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1986)

> It was narrated that Ash'ath bin Qais said: "I was a guest (at the home) of 'Umar one night, and in the middle of the night he went and hit his wife, and I separated them. When he went to bed he said to me: 'O Ash'ath, learn from me something that I heard from the Messenger of Allah" A man should not be asked why he beats his wife...

## No women has it worse than Muslim women {#muslimas-treated-worst}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5825](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5825)
 
> Rifa'a divorced his wife whereupon AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. Aisha said that the lady came, wearing a green veil and complained to her (Aisha) of her husband and showed her a green spot on her skin caused by beating. It was the habit of ladies to support each other, so when Allah's Messenger came, Aisha said, "I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women. Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!"…

Even Aisha, the "mother of the believers", admits that no women are treated as poorly as Muslim women. This muslima was beaten so severely that her bruises were greener than her green veil.

## Women are to be plowed like a field {#plowing-women}

Surah 2:223 

> Your wives are your fields, so plow into your fields whichever way you like

## Pedophilia encouraged {#pedophilia-ok}

Surah 65:4

Context from Surah 65:1:

> O Prophet! ˹Instruct the believers:˺ **When you intend to˺ divorce women, then divorce them with concern for their waiting period**...

There's a waiting period a divorced woman has to wait before she can remarry.  

> As for your women past the age of menstruation, in case you do not know, their waiting period is three months, **and those who have not menstruated as well**. As for those who are pregnant, their waiting period ends with delivery. And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make their matters easy for them.

This means men are allowed to marry and divorce prepubescent girls.

## Most people in hell are women {#most-in-hell-women}

[Sahih al Bukhari 304](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:304)

>  Allah's Messenger … passed by the women and said, "O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women)." …

The reason for this is because Allah created women to have menstruation, meaning they can't pray and fast as much.

## Women are "deficient in intelligence"

[Sahih al Bukhari 304](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:304)

> I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence … than you.… The women asked… "What is deficient in our intelligence…?" He said, "Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?" They replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her intelligence."

See also [Sahih al Bukhari 2658](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2658)


## The testimony of a woman is worth half that of a man

Surah 2:282

> Call upon two of your men to witness. If two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice will witness—so if one of the women forgets the other may remind her.

[Sahih al Bukhari 304](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:304)

> [Muhammad] said, "Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?"

In Islam, women are considered to be half as intelligent and trustworthy as a man, therefore if two men can not be found to witness the contract, one man and two women would suffice. Apparently women are so unreliable that they need to remind one another what to say.

See also [Sahih al Bukhari 2658](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2658)

## Women are "deficient in religion"

[Sahih al Bukhari 304](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:304)

> I have not seen anyone more deficient in … religion than you. … Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses? … This is the deficiency in her religion.

See also [Sahih al Bukhari 2658](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2658)

So since women can't pray or fast during their period, they are seen as deficient. Therefore ["most people in hell are women"](#most-in-hell-women) But it is Allah who made women that way, so it is Allah's fault if this would be the case. What an absolute arsehole.

## Women are equal to donkeys and dogs 

[Sahih al Bukhari 514](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:514)

> The things which annul prayer were mentioned before me (and those were): a dog, a donkey and a woman. I said, "You have compared us (women) to donkeys and dogs...
