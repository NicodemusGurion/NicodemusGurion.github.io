# Paradise

The Islamic paradise is a very physical place where people will eat fruit that all tastes the same. Then they will not poop, but belch out the excrement as musk.

## All fruit looks the same in paradise {#boring-fruit}

[Quran 2:25](https://quran.com/2/25)

> And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens under which rivers flow. Every time they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” for they will be given fruit that resemble one another. They will have purified spouses, and they will abide therein forever.

## Paradise dwellers don't poop but belch and sweat musk {#belching-musk}

> I heard Allah's Apostle as saying that the inmates of Paradise would eat and drink but would neither spit, nor pass water, nor void excrement, nor suffer catarrah. It was said: Then, what would happen with food? Thereupon he said: They would belch and sweat (and it would be over with their food), and their sweat would be that of musk and they would glorify and praise Allah as easily as you breathe.

## Paradise dwellers will have large-eyed houris {#houris}

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their wives will be large-eyed maidens...

## Paradise dwellers will be 38.4 meters tall {#tall-people}

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their form would be alike as one single person after the form of their father (Adam) sixty cubits tall.

60 Arabic cubits á 64cm each equals 38.4 meters.

## There are 7 heavens {#seven-heavens}

Surah 2:29

> It is He Who created for you all that is in the earth, then He turned towards the heaven and made them seven heavens...








# Prayer

## Looking up while praying makes you go blind {#praying-looking-up-blind}

[Sahih al Bukhari 750](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:750)

> The Prophet said, "What is wrong with those people who look towards the sky during the prayer?" His talk grew stern while delivering this speech and he said, "They should stop (looking towards the sky during the prayer); otherwise their eyesight would be taken away."

## Looking up while praying turns your head into a donkey head {#praying-looking-up-donkey}

[Sahih al Bukhari 691](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:691)

> The Prophet said, "Isn't he who raises his head before the Imam afraid that Allah may transform his head into that of a donkey or his figure into that of a donkey?"







# The Quran {#quran}

## The original Quranic manuscripts were burned 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4987](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4987)

> ... So Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, "Send us the manuscripts of the Qur'an so that we may compile the Qur'anic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you."...Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Qur'anic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt.

We have no way of confirming that the current Quran is uncorrupted or even the same as the message Muhammad delivered.

## The Quran confirms the Bible {#confirms-bible}

Surah 2: 88-91

> And when there comes to them a Book from Allah, **confirming what is with them**… When it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah Hath sent down, "they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us:" yet they reject all besides, even if it be Truth **confirming what is with them**…

The Quran confirms the Bible that was available in the 7th century as being uncorrupted and coming from Allah. [We have extant copies that are even 300](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Sinaiticus)-[900 years older than the Quran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls), and they are identical to our modern Bibles. This disproves the idea some Muslims put forth that the Bible has been corrupted.

## How to know if the Quran is inspired {#proof-of-inspiration}

Surah 2:23-24

> 23 If you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down upon Our slave, then produce a chapter like it and call upon your helpers other than Allah, if you are truthful.24 But if you did not do it, and you can never do it; then beware of the Fire whose fuel will be people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers.

The only claim to inspiration the Quran makes is in its literary excellence, claiming no one can produce a chapter like it. But if you have read it the first thing that strikes you is that literary speaking, it is garbage. Even a mediocre poet would be able to write a chapter far more excellent than most chapters of the Quran.

## The Quran is not perfectly preserved {#not-preserved}

One miraculous claim made is that the Quran has been perfectly preserved. However the Quran and Hadiths contradict this.

### Allah foretold that the Quran wouldn’t be perfectly preserved {#no-preservation}

Surah 2:106

> If We ever abrogate a verse or **cause it to be forgotten**, We replace it with a better or similar one. Do you not know that Allah is Most Capable of everything?

### Two chapters of the Quran were forgotten {#surahs-forgotten}

[Sahih Muslim 1050](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1050)

> Abu Harb b. Abu al-Aswad… We used to recite a surah which resembled in length and severity to (Surah) Bara'at. **I have, however, forgotten it** with the exception of this which I remember out of it:" If there were two valleys full of riches, for the son of Adam, he would long for a third valley, and nothing would fill the stomach of the son of Adam but dust." And we used so recite a surah which resembled one of the surahs of Musabbihat, and **I have forgotten it**, but remember (this much) out of it:" Oh people who believe, why do you say that which you do not practise" and" that is recorded in your necks as a witness (against you) and you would be asked about it on the Day of Resurrection"

This reciter admits that they **used to recite** two surahs meaning it was once part of the Quran, but that they just forgot them. He remembers some fragments, but these match nothin in the Quran, proving that these surahs are gone forever. This proves the Quran has not been perfectly preserved.

### Two chapters of the Quran were eaten by a sheep {#sheep-ate-surahs}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 1944](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1944)

> It was narrated that 'Aishah said “The Verse of stoning and of breastfeeding an adult ten times was revealed, and the paper was with me under my pillow. When the Messenger of Allah died, we were preoccupied with his death, and a tame sheep came in and ate it.”

How can the Quran be perfectly preserved when two Surah's were literally eaten by a sheep?

## Chapters of the Quran could be ordered on demand {#surah-on-demand}

[Sahih al Bukhari 4483](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4483)

> I also said, 'O Allah's Messenger ! Good and bad persons visit you! Would that you ordered the Mothers of the believers to cover themselves with veils.' So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were revealed. 

Apparently, chapters could be requested on demand by the followers of Muhammad to suit their personal preferences. How convenient.

## Denying a Quran verse is a capital offense {#denying-quran}

> It was narrated from Ibn'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah said:
> “Whoever denies a Verse of the Qur'an, it is permissible to strike his neck (i.e., execute him) 

See also [Apostasy](#apostasy)

## A Christian wrote the Quran

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3617](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3617)

> There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read Surat-al-Baqara and Al-Imran, and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: "Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him."

At least part of the Quran was written down by or edited by a Christian convert to Islam (and later re-convert to Christianity). He claimed to understand it better than Muhammad.










# Racism

## Muhammad traded black slaves {#black-slaves}

[Sahih Muslim 1602](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1602)

> Jabir … reported: There came a slave and pledged allegiance to Allah's Apostle on migration; [who] did not know that he was a slave. Then there came his master and demanded him back, whereupon Allah's Apostle said: Sell him to me. And he bought him for two black slaves…

It seems the exchange rate is two black slaves for one Muslim slave.

This is from chapter 23 which heading  reads:

> Chapter 23: The permissibility of **selling animals for animals of the same kind and of different quality**

## Black people are created for hell {#blacks-made-for-hell}

> …“God created Adam when He created him and struck his right shoulder and brought forth his offspring white like small ants. And he struck his left shoulder and brought forth his offspring black as though they were charcoal. Then He said to the party on his right side, ‘To paradise, and I do not care’ and He said to the party in his left shoulder, ‘To hell, and I do not care’.”

According to Muhammed, white people are destined for heaven and black people are destined for hell.

## Turks look like their faces were hit with a hammer {#turks}

[Sahih Muslim 2912 d](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2912d)

> The Last Hour would not come until the Muslims fight with the Turks-a people whose faces would be like hammered shields wearing clothes of hair and walking (with shoes) of hair.

Another description of Turks:

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2928](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2928)

> …The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Turks; people with small eyes, red faces, and flat noses. Their faces will look like shields coated with leather…

## Ethiopians have heads like raisins {#raisin-heads}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 693](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:693)

> "Listen and obey (your chief) even if an Ethiopian whose head is like a raisin were made your chief."

## Muhammad didn't like black dogs {#black-dogs}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3205](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3205)

> Were it not that dogs form one of the communities, I would have commanded that they be killed. But kill those that are all black...

## Black people symbolize disease {#black-disease}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 7039](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7039)

> …I saw in a dream a black woman with unkempt hair going out of Medina and settling at Mahai'a. I interpreted that as a symbol of the epidemic of Medina being transferred to Mahai'a…

When Muhammad sees a black woman in a dream he automatically assumes she represents an epidemic.

## On judgement day, people will turn white or black {#blackface-hell}

Surah 3:106-107

> on a day when some faces are whitened and some faces are blackened. So as for those whose faces were blackened: “Did you deny after having attained faith?” Then taste the punishment on account of what you used to deny. And as for those whose faces were whitened—(they are) in Allah’s mercy; therein they abide.






# Rape

## It is ok to rape captured women {#raping-captives}

[Sunan Abi Dawud 2155](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2155)

> Abu Sa’id Al Khudri said “The Apostle of Allaah sent a military expedition to Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain. They met their enemy and fought with them. They defeated them and took them captives. Some of the Companions of Apostle of Allah were reluctant to have relations with the female captives because of their pagan husbands. So, Allaah the exalted sent down the Qur’anic verse “And all married women are forbidden unto you save those captives whom your right hand posses.” This is to say that they are lawful for them when they complete their waiting period.

**Those captives whom your right hand posses** means captives taken in war. The Muslims at this battle, horny perverts though they were, at least had the basic human decency of not raping women in front of their husbands. So this verse that Muhammad conveniently came up with makes it permissible for Muslim men to rape women that they take captive.

[Quran 4:24](https://quran.com/4/24)

> Also ˹forbidden are˺ married women—except ˹female˺ captives in your possession...

## Muslims don't have to worry about getting their rape victims pregnant

[Sahih Muslim 1438a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1438a)

> We went out with Allah's Messenger on the expedition to the Bi'l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing [interrupted coitus]. But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah's Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah's Messenger, and he said: It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born.

Not only are Muslims allowed to rape women, but can just discard them like trash and not bother about them becoming pregnant.







# Salvation 

How Muslims are saved on judgment day is confusing and contradictory.

## Jews and Christians are also saved

Surah 2:62

> The [Muslim] believers, the Jews, the Christians, and the Sabians- all those who believe in God and the Last Day and do good- will have their rewards with their Lord. 

## No ransom 

Surah 2:48

> Guard yourselves against a Day when no soul will stand in place of another, no intercession will be accepted for it, nor any ransom; nor will they be helped.

So there will be no ransom for anyone. This contradicts [other sources saying that Muslims can be ransomed](#ransomed-from-hell). 


## Ransomed from hell by Jews and Christians {#ransomed-from-hell}

[Sahih Muslim 2767 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2767a)

> Abu Musa' reported that Allah's Messenger said:
> When it will be the Day of Resurrection Allah would deliver to every Muslim a Jew or a Christian and say: That is your rescue from Hell-Fire.

Christianity teaches that Jesus is the perfect one who does not deserve hellfire but took this punishment in stead of those who have faith in him. Some Muslims think this is unjust saying that it's wrong that someone should take the punishment for someone else's sin. However here, Allah will let Jews and Christians take the punishment for the sins of Muslims. Is that just, though?

Als this implies that Jews and Christians as not sinners deserving of hell, but that Muslims are sinners deserving of hell. Otherwise, if the Jews and Christians were already in hell, the exchange could not be made.

## The Quran will come and intercede

[Sahih Muslim 804 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:804a)

> Recite the Qur'an, for on the Day of Resurrection it will come as an intercessor for those who recite It. Recite the two bright ones, al-Baqara and Surah Al 'Imran, for on the Day of Resurrection they will come as two clouds or two shades, or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them.

Islam teaches that the Quran is actually alive and will function as an intercessor on the day of judgment. It will come as clouds, shades, or flocks of birds, and it will speak, pleading for Muslims.

# Satan

## Satan urinates in your ear

[Sahih al Bukhari 1144](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1144)

> Narrated 'Abdullah: A person was mentioned before the Prophet and he was told that he had kept on sleeping till morning and had not got up for the prayer. The Prophet said, "Satan urinated in his ears."

## Satan farts to not hear the call to prayer {#satan-farts}

[Sahih Muslim 389a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:389a)

> When Satan hears the call to prayer, he turns back and breaks the wind so as not to hear the call being made...

## Yawning is from Satan

[Sahih al Bukhari 3289](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3289)

> Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, "Yawning is from Satan and if anyone of you yawns, he should check his yawning as much as possible, for if anyone of you (during the act of yawning) should say: 'Ha', Satan will laugh at him."

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2746](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2746)

> Allah loves the sneeze and He dislikes the Yawn, so when a man says Ah, Ah when yawning, indeed Ash-Shaitan laughs from inside his opening.

## Satan likes bells

[Sahih Muslim 2114](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2114)

> The bell is the musical instrument of the Satan.

Funny since in [Sahih al Bukhari 2](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2)  Muhammad says that his revelations were often like the ringing of a bell, so you don't have to wonder about it's true source.

> Al-Harith bin Hisham asked Allah's Messenger "O Allah's Messenger! How is the Divine Inspiration revealed to you?" Allah's Messenger replied, "Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of all and then this state passes off after I have grasped what is inspired.

> When you hear the braying of a donkey, then seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, for, verily, it has seen a Shaitan.

## Muhammad had a Satan

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3960](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3960)

> I said: "Don't you have a Shaitan?" He said: "Yes, but Allah helped me with him, so he submitted."


## Muhammad once defeated Satan in a wrestling match

[Sahih al Bukhari 1210](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1210)

> Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, "Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. Then I remembered the statement of Prophet Solomon, 'My Lord ! Bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.' Then Allah made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated)."







# Science

## Earth existed before space

Surah 2:29

> He is the One Who created everything in the earth for you. Then He turned towards the heaven, forming it into seven heavens. 

## Sperm comes from between the backbone and the ribs

Surah 86:6-7

> ˹They were˺ created from a spurting fluid, stemming from between the backbone and the ribcage.

## The sun sets in a muddy spring 

[Quran 18:86](https://quran.com/18/86?translations=17)

> Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a muddy spring, and he found a people at it. We said, "O Thulqarnayn, either you will torment them or you will take to yourself towards them a fair way."

## The earth is flat

[Quran 18:86](https://quran.com/71/19?translations=207)

> Allah has laid the earth out as a carpet for you,

## What determines if a child looks like its mother or father?

[Sahih al Bukhari 3329](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3329)

> If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife and gets discharge first, the child will resemble the father, and if the woman gets discharge first, the child will resemble her.

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 200](https://sunnah.com/nasai:200)

> 'The man's water is thick and white, and the woman's water is thin and yellow. Whichever of them comes first, the child will resemble (that parent).'"

## The urine of boys and girls are different

[Sunnan Ibn Majah 525](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:525)

> …He said, "This is because the urine of the boy is of water and clay, but the urine of the girl is of flesh and blood."…

## Non-Muslims eats in seven intestines, Muslims in one {#seven-intestines}

Apparently belief or disbelief in Islam changes the number of intestines you have.

[Sahih Muslim 2060 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2060a)

> …a non-Muslim eats in seven intestines whereas a Muslim eats in one intestine.

> There is nothing of the human body that does not decay except one bone; that is the little bone at the end of the coccyx of which the human body will be recreated on the Day of Resurrection.

I'm pretty sure it does, eventually.









# Sex slaves

See also [Rape](#rape), [Women](#women)

## Muslims men can have sex slaves

Surah 4:3 

> If you fear you might fail to give orphan women their ˹due˺ rights ˹if you were to marry them˺, then marry other women of your choice—two, three, or four. But if you are afraid you will fail to maintain justice, then ˹content yourselves with˺ one or those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession.

A muslim man can marry up to four women, but if he thinks he can not give them their legal rights, he can just "content himself" one wife, **or** those "bondswomen" in his posession. the footnote on quran.com says "A bondwoman is a female slave that a man owned either through purchase or taking her captive in war."

Surah 33:50

> O Prophet! We have made lawful for you your wives to whom you have paid their ˹full˺ dowries as well as those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession, whom Allah has granted you... We have ordained for the believers in relation to their wives and those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession.

"Made lawful" means that he can have sex with them.

Surah 23:5-6; 70:29-30

> [Sucessful are the believers...] those who guard their chastity except with their wives or those [bondswomen] in their possession, for then they are free from blame

This passage says that a muslim should be chaste except with their wives (plural) or "those their right hand posesses", which would be women they have taken captive in war or bought as slaves. It's allowed for muslim men to have slaves that they have sex with and these slave women can not refuse them.

Surah 4:24

> Also ˹forbidden are˺ married women—except ˹female˺ captives in your possession.

They're not allowed to have sex with married women **except** if these **married women** have been captured in battle. Then it is allowed to have sex with these **married women**.

# Sin

## Allah predetermines adultery

[Sahih Muslim 2657 b](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2657b)

> Verily Allah has fixed the very portion of adultery which a man will indulge in, and which he of necessity must commit.

A man who commits adultery is really only doing the will of Allah, and has no choice in it.

# Slavery

See also [Muhammad and slavery](#muhammad-and-slavery)

## Runaway slaves lack protection

[Mishkat al-Masabih 3350](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:3350)

> If any slave runs away protection does not apply to him.

Compare to the Mosaic law in Deuteronomy 23:15-16:

> “You shall not give up to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you. He shall dwell with you, in your midst, in the place that he shall choose within one of your towns, wherever it suits him. You shall not wrong him.

## Gifting slaves is better than freeing them

[Sahih Muslim 999](https://sunnah.com/muslim:999)

> Maimuna bint Harith reported that she set free a slave-girl during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah and she made a mention of that to the Messenger of Allah and he said: Had you given her to your maternal uncles, you would have a greater reward.

## Black slaves are worth half of Arab slaves {#black-slaves-worth-less}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 4621](https://sunnah.com/nasai:4621Sunan an-Nasa'i 4621

> "A slave came and gave his pledge to the Messenger of Allah to emigrate, and the Prophet did not realize that he was a slave. Then his master came looking for him. The Prophet said; 'Sell him to me.' So he bought him for two black slaves, then he did not accept until he had asked; 'Is he a slave?'''









# Violence

See also [Jihad](#jihad), [Muhammad and violence](#muhammad-and-violence).

## Fighting is obligatory 

Surah 2:216

> Fighting has been made obligatory upon you ˹believers˺, though you dislike it. Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know.

Apparently Allah thinks violence is good for humans. 

## Killing unbelievers

Surah 3:151-152

> We will **throw terror into the hearts** of those who have denied because they associated with Allah (partners) for which He bestowed from on high no authority. And their shelter is the Fire, and how miserable is the dwelling of the unjust! And very truly Allah fulfilled His promise to you **as you killed them** by His permission, until when you faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter and disobeyed after He had shown you what you love: …

Allah will use **terror** against unbelievers. By what method? By Muslims **killing them by His permission**. And then Allah will burn them in **the Fire** forever. But is this a coincidence? No, if a Muslims had a shred of humanity and **faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter** whether terrorism is good, Allah sees that as them having **disobeyed** him.

## Kill unbelievers wherever you find them

Surah 4:89

> They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you may all be alike. So do not take them as allies unless they emigrate in the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take any of them as allies or helpers,

Do not befriend unbelievers but **seize them and kill them wherever you find them**.

Surah 4:91

> You will find others who wish to be safe from you and their own people. Yet they cannot resist the temptation ˹of disbelief or hostility˺. If they do not keep away, offer you peace, or refrain from attacking you, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. We have given you full permission over such people.

If someone just wants to **be safe from** Islam and just want to live their life in peace and not be bothered, then **seize them and kill them** too.

## Allah likes terrorists more than peaceful Muslims 

Surah 4:95

>  Those believers who stay at home—except those with valid excuses1—are not equal to those who strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives.…

## The penalty for resisting Islam

Surah 5:33

> Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land**. This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.

In case you wage war against Islam, for example by exposing what a horrible ideology it is, your punishment is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land** and then to burn in hell for all eternity.


## Beheading unbelievers

Surah 8:12

> … I will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers. So strike their necks and strike their fingertips.”

Ever wondered why Islamic terrorists behead their victims? It's by the book.

## Not fighting for Islam is punished with hell

Surah 8:15-16


> O believers! When you face the disbelievers in battle, never turn your backs to them. And whoever does so on such an occasion—unless it is a manoeuvre or to join their own troops—will earn the displeasure of Allah, and their home will be Hell. What an evil destination!

A Muslim who chickens out and turns his back on a disbeliever will go to hell.

## Behead enemies

[Quran 47:4](https://quran.com/47?startingVerse=4&translations=149)

> Thus, when you encounter those who have denied, strike at their necks. Then when you have subjugated them, bind them firmly…

## Plundering is ok if no one is watching

[Sahih al Bukhari 6772](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6772)

> … when a robber robs and the people look at him, then he is not a believer at the time of doing it.…

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3936](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3936)

> …the plunderer, at the time he is plundering with the people looking on, is not a believer.

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3935](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3935)

> “Whoever plunders openly is not one of us.”

So plundering only makes a Muslim a nonbeliever under the condition that they do it openly when someone is watching. If it's done in secret it's no problem.







# Weird or miscellaneous 

## "The eyes are the leather strap of the anus"

[Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 956](https://sunnah.com/adab:956)

> …"When one of you breaks his sandal-strap, he should not walk in his other sandal until it is mended."

## Moses had his clothes stolen by a stone

[Sahih al Bukhari 278](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:278)

> ...once Moses went out to take a bath and put his clothes over a stone and then that stone ran away with his clothes. Moses followed that stone saying, "My clothes, O stone! My clothes, O stone!...

## Unbelievers visiting a mosque will go to hell

Surah 9:17-18

> Never was it befitting for the polytheists to attend Allah’s mosques while professing their denial. Those—their deeds were nullified, and in the Fire they abide.Surely, Allah’s mosques can only be attended by one who has attained faith in Allah…

## Muslims living abroad goes to hell

> When the angels seize the souls of those who have wronged themselves — scolding them, “What was wrong with you?” they will reply, “We were oppressed in the land.” The angels will respond, “Was Allah’s earth not spacious enough for you to emigrate?” It is they who will have Hell as their home—what an evil destination!

When muslims who live outside of Islamic countries (i.e. them being **opressed in the land**) die, the angel of death will scold them for not living in an Islamic country (i.e. **Allah’s earth**), and send them to hell.

## Snakes in houses may be demons who converted to islam {#snake-jinn}

This teaching is spread out over many Hadiths, but pieced together the gist is: 

Muhammad said that you should kill snakes outside, but if you find a snake inside your house you shouldn't kill it right away. The story goes that a young man found a snake in his house and pierced it with his spear, but it attacked and killed him. People asked Muhammad to pray that he be resurrected but he said that snakes found in houses are jinns (demons) and that some jinns have accepted Islam and become Muslims. So if you find a snake in your house it could be a fellow Muslim, and therefore you should command it to not hurt you but to leave for three days. If it doesn't obey by the fourth day, it's a devil and you should kill it.

## Deathbed convert couldn't be buried

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3930](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3930)

> …[In battle, a] man … attacked an idolator man with a spear, and when he was defeated he said: “I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, I am a Muslim.” But he stabbed him and killed him…We buried him, but the following morning he was on the surface of the earth. They said: “Perhaps an enemy of his disinterred him.” So we buried him (again) and told our slaves to stand guard. But the following morning he was on the surface of the earth again then we said: ‘Perhaps the slaves dozed off.’ So we buried him (again) and stood guard ourselves, but the following morning he was on the surface of the earth (again). So we threw him into one of these mountain passes.’”

Apparently it was impossible to keep this deathbed convert in the ground, so they did the only sensible thing and **threw him into one of these mountain passes**. As you do.

## It's ok for a man to beat his wife

Surah 4:34

> Men stand caretakers of women since Allah has made some of them excel the others, and because they have spent of their wealth., So, the righteous women are obedient, guarding in absence with the protection given by Allah. As for women whose disobedience you fear, convince them, and leave them apart in beds, and **beat them**. Then, if they obey you, do not seek a way against them. Surely, Allah is the Highest, the Greatest.

This is if a man even only fears his wife would be disobedient.

## Women are to be plowed like a field

Surah 2:223 

> Your wives are your fields, so go into your fields whichever way you like

## No women has it worse than Muslim women

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5825](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5825)
 
> Rifa'a divorced his wife whereupon AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. Aisha said that the lady came, wearing a green veil and complained to her (Aisha) of her husband and showed her a green spot on her skin caused by beating. It was the habit of ladies to support each other, so when Allah's Messenger came, Aisha said, "I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women. Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!"…

Even Aisha, the "mother of the believers", admits that no women are treated as poorly as Muslim women. This muslima was beaten so severely that her bruises were greener than her green veil.

## It's ok to marry and divorce girls who have not yet menstruated

Surah 65:4

Context from Surah 65:1:

> O Prophet! ˹Instruct the believers:˺ **When you intend to˺ divorce women, then divorce them with concern for their waiting period**...

There's a waiting period a divorced woman has to wait before she can remarry.  

> As for your women past the age of menstruation, in case you do not know, their waiting period is three months, **and those who have not menstruated as well**. As for those who are pregnant, their waiting period ends with delivery. And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make their matters easy for them.

This means men are allowed to marry and divorce prepubescent girls.

## The majority of people in hell are women

[Sahih al Bukhari 304](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:304)

> Once Allah's Messenger  went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) of 'Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by the women and said, "O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women)." …

## Women are mentally deficient 

[Sahih al Bukhari 2658](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2658)

> The Prophet said, "Isn't the witness of a woman equal to half of that of a man?" The women said, "Yes." He said, "This is because of the deficiency of a woman's mind."

Also:

- [Sahih al Bukhari 304](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:304)

## The testimony of a woman is worth half that of a man

Surah 2:282

> Call upon two of your men to witness. If two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice will witness—so if one of the women forgets the other may remind her.

In Islam, women are considered to be half as intelligent and trustworthy as a man, therefore if two men can not be found to witness the contract, one man and two women would suffice. Apparently women are so unreliable that they need to remind one another what to say.

## Women are equal to donkeys and dogs 

[Sahih al Bukhari 514](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:514)

> The things which annul prayer were mentioned before me (and those were): a dog, a donkey and a woman. I said, "You have compared us (women) to donkeys and dogs...
