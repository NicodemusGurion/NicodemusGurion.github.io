# Obvious fraud
{:.no_toc}


As most liars and cult leaders, Muhammad could not keep his lies straight, and many of the things he said made it obvious that he was defrauding people. Here are some examples.

# Allah pampers Muhammad {#allah-serves-muhammad}

[Sahih al Bukhari 4788](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4788)

> Narrated Aisha:… I said (to the Prophet), "I feel that your Lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires."

Even Aisha noticed that the "revelations" that Muhammad got from Allah were suspiciously self-serving. Any time Muhammad had any wish, Allah came with a convenient revelation permitting him to go ahead. Why would the creator of the universe put in so much effort to make sure one man had every wish fulfilled? It's almost like Muhammad only used Allah as a puppet to convince people to fulfill his desires.


## Islam is all about loving Muhammad

[Sahih al-Bukhari 14](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:14)

> Allah's Messenger said, "By Him in Whose Hands my life is, none of you will have faith till he loves me more than his father and his children.

## Unlimited women for Muhammad {#unlimited-women}

Surah 33:50-51

> Prophet, We have made lawful for you the wives whose bride gift you have paid, and any slaves God has assigned to you through war, and the daughters of your uncles and aunts on your father’s and mother’s sides, who migrated with you. Also any believing woman who has offered herself to the Prophet and whom the Prophet wishes to wed- this is only for you [Prophet] and not the rest of the believers…

> You may make any of [your women] wait and receive any of them as you wish, but you will not be at fault if you invite one whose turn you have previously set aside…

Regular muslim men were "only" allowed to marry 4 women, but Allah made a specific rule, included in their "holy book for people of all ages", that Muhammad, and only Muhammad, could marry as many women as he wanted, and have as many sex slaves as he wanted. And he didn't have to follow any rules regarding visiting them. This is obviously Muhammad making up rules to benefit himself and telling people that Allah said it.

## Free sex for Muhammad {#free-sex}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3959](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3959)

> It was narrated from Anas, that the Messenger of Allah had a female slave with whom he had intercourse, but 'Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: "O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.' until the end of the Verse.

Horndog that he was, Muhammad [was not satisfied with 11 wives](#eleven-wives) but started having sex with a slave girl. His wives Aisha and Hansah were upset and demanded he promise never to do it again, to which he obliged. But later Allah conveniently gave him the revelation in Surah 66:1-6 that says that Muhammad can have sex with any woman he wishes and if his wives complain about it, Allah will replace them with better wives. And he threatens them with hell for having the audacity to ask their husband to not be unfaithful. How convenient.

## Allah annulled adoption so Muhammad could marry his son's wife {#anulling-adoption}

See: [The time Muhammad stole his son's wife](/The-time-Muhammad-stole-his-sons-wife)

# Allah follows Muhammad's will

## Allah allows Muhammad to attack his enemies

[Sunan an-Nasa’i 3085](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3085)

> “When the Prophet was expelled from Makkah, … it was revealed: ‘Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers) who are fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is able to give them (believers) victory.’ Then I knew that there would be fighting.” Ibn Abbas said: “This is the first Verse that was revealed concerning fighting.”


When Muhammad and his tiny band of followers were kicked out of Mecca for being a nuisance, Muhammad suddenly had a convenient revelation (Surah 23:39) where Allah gave him permission to convert his cult into the death machine that has plagued mankind since.

## Allah changed the Qiblah for Muhammad 

[Allah changed the direction all Muslims must pray just because Muhammad wanted it.](#jerusalem-qiblah)

[Sunan Ibn Majah 1010](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1010)

> When the Messenger of Allah prayed towards Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem), he would often lift his face towards the heavens, and Allah knew what was in the heart of His Prophet and how **he longed to face the Ka’bah (during prayer).** Jibril appeared (in the sky), and the Messenger of Allah started watching him as he was descending between the heavens and the earth, waiting to see what he would bring. Then Allah revealed the words: ‘Verily, We have seen the turning of your face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah **that shall please you**, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah). And wherever you people are, turn your faces (during prayer) in that direction.’ 

Allah surely did everything to please Muhammad's most frivolous whims, even changing one of the most fundamental rituals of Islam.


# Allah protects Muhammad 

## Allah gets Muhammads wives off his back for cheating

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3959](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3959)

> It was narrated from Anas, that the Messenger of Allah had a female slave with whom he had intercourse, but 'Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: "O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.' until the end of the Verse.

The verse revealed was Surah 66:1-6. [Tafsir al-Jalalayn](http://web.archive.org/web/20220221075859/https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&tTafsirNo=74&tSoraNo=66&tAyahNo=1&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2) says about Surah 66:1-6:

> O Prophet! Why do you prohibit what God has made lawful for you in terms of your Coptic handmaiden Māriya — when he lay with her in the house of Hafsa who had been away but who upon returning and finding out became upset by the fact that this had taken place in her own house and on her own bed — by saying ‘She is unlawful for me!’ seeking by making her unlawful for you to please your wives? And God is Forgiving Merciful having forgiven you this prohibition.

Muhammad was having sex with his sex slave Maria the Copt in the house of his wife Hansa, and quite understandably his wives complained. But then Allah conveniently revealed Surah 66:1-6, that Muhammad can do that if he wishes, and if his wives complain, he should divorce them and they can literally go to hell. 

## Allah defends Muhammad against accusations of theft

[Sunan Abi Dawud 3971](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3971)

> Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: The verse "And no Prophet could (ever) be false to his trust" was revealed about a red velvet. When it was found missing on the day of Badr, some people said; Perhaps the Messenger of Allah has taken it. So Allah, the Exalted, sent down "And no prophet could (ever) be false to his trust" to the end of the verse.

After the battle of Badr, the Muslims were dividing up the spoil, and apparently a piece of red velvet cloth was missing. The immediate suspicion of the other Muslim was that Muhammad had stolen it.

You have to wonder why, rather than being beyond suspicion, Muhammad was the very first suspect when something was missing?

So to defend himself, "Allah" revealed the verse Surah 3:161:

> It is inconceivable that a prophet would ever dishonestly take something from the battle gains. Anyone who does so will carry it with him on the Day of Resurrection, when each soul will be fully repaid for what it has done: no one will be wronged.

So essentially "Allah" says "No, Muhammad is innocent. Trust me bro." But the same all-knowing Allah was unable to point out who the real thief was? That not only did not solve the problem, but rather makes Muhammad look more suspicious.

# Allah protects Muhammad from minor nuisances 

## Dinner instructions 

Surah 33:53

> O believers! Do not enter the homes of the Prophet without permission ˹and if invited˺ for a meal, do not ˹come too early and˺ linger until the meal is ready. But if you are invited, then enter ˹on time˺. Once you have eaten, then go on your way, and do not stay for casual talk. Such behaviour is truly annoying to the Prophet, yet he is too shy to ask you to leave. But Allah is never shy of the truth. And when you ˹believers˺ ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and theirs. And it is not right for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever marry his wives after him. This would certainly be a major offence in the sight of Allah.

Apparently Allah is even concerned about Muhammad not having to suffer the awkwardness of dismissing his dinner guests. This is obviously made up by Muhammad because he felt it too awkward to do, so he uses Allah as his puppet to order people around. 

## Don't slap your tongue {#slap-tongue}

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2853](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2853)

> the Messenger of Allah said: "Indeed Allah detests the excessive among men, who slaps his tongue around like the cow slaps his tongue."

Why would the creator of the universe be concerned with how someone moves their tongue? This is obviously Muhammad being annoyed and using Allah as an excuse to have people stop smacking their tongues while eating.

## Don't talk nonsense with Muhammad 

Surah 2: 104

> Say not (to the Messenger) words of ambiguous import, but words of respect

Allah is oddly concerned with people not annoying Muhammad with unnecessary speech.
