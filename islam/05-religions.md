## Apostasy

How to deal with those who leave islam.

## Punishment for apostasy is death {#apostasy-death-sentence}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6922](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6922)

> Some Zanadiqa (atheists) were brought to Ali and he burnt them. The news of this event, reached Ibn Abbas who said, "If I had been in his place, I would not have burnt them, as Allah's Messenger forbade it, saying, 'Do not punish anybody with Allah's punishment (fire).' I would have killed them according to the statement of Allah's Messenger, 'Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him.'"

[Muwatta Malik 36:15](https://sunnah.com/urn/514180)

> the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If someone changes his deen (religion) - strike his neck!" The meaning of the statement of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in our opinion and Allah knows best, is that "if someone changes his deen, strike his neck!" refers to those who leave Islam for other than it - like the heretics and their like, about whom it is known. They are killed without being called to tawba (repentance) because their tawba is not recognised. They were hiding their kufr and publishing their Islam, so I do not think that one calls such people to tawba, and one does not accept their word. As for the one who goes out of Islam to something else and divulges it, one calls him to tawba. If he does not turn in tawba, he is killed. If there are people in that situation, I think that one should call them to Islam and call them to tawba. If they turn in tawba, that is accepted from them. If they do not turn in tawba, they are killed. 

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2535](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2535)

> “Whoever changes his religion, execute him.”

## Islam is a strange serpent receding into its hole {#strange-serpent}

[Sahih Muslim 146](https://sunnah.com/muslim:146)

> the Messenger of Allah observed: Verily Islam started as something strange and it would again revert (to its old position) of being strange just as it started, and it would recede between the two mosques just as the serpent crawls back into its hole.

If he was a prophet then let's hope this prophecy comes true at least.

## Islam means following Muhammad 

Surah 4:65

> But no! By your Lord, they will never be ˹true˺ believers until they accept you ˹O Prophet˺ as the judge in their disputes, and find no resistance within themselves against your decision and submit wholeheartedly.

## View of non-Muslims

Surah 98:6

> Indeed, those who disbelieve from the People of the Book and the polytheists will be in the Fire of Hell, to stay there forever. They are the worst of ˹all˺ beings

Islam views non-Muslims as the worst of all beings.

## Leaving Islam

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 4061](https://sunnah.com/nasai:4061)

> "The Messenger of Allah said: 'Whoever changes his religion, kill him.'"


## Backgammon is forbidden

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3763](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3763)

> Whoever plays backgammon, it is as if he dipped his hand in the flesh and blood of a pig.

## Stoning is monkey business 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3849](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3849)

> During the pre-lslamic period of ignorance I saw a she-monkey surrounded by a number of monkeys. They were all stoning it, because it had committed illegal sexual intercourse. I too, stoned it along with them.

Seems like monkeys and Muslims are allies in woman hating.















# Non-muslims, Jews and Christians

## Muslims should listen to and learn from Christians and Jews {#listen-to-christians}

Surah 29:46

> Do not argue with the People of the Book unless gracefully, except with those of them who act wrongfully. 

Surah 16:43;21:7

> [Prophet], all the messengers We sent before you were simply men to whom We had given the Revelation: you [people] can ask those who have knowledge if you do not know.

Surah 10:94

> If you are in doubt about what We have revealed to you, then ask those who read the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt,

Muslims should not argue with Christians but listen and learn from them what Allah has really taught.

## Jews

## Christians

### Christians must judge by the Gospel

Surah 5:47

> So let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed in it. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the rebellious.

### Allah promised that Christians will be superior until judgment day 

Surah 3:55

> God said, ‘Jesus, I will take you back and raise you up to Me: I will purify you of the disbelievers. To the Day of Resurrection **I will make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieved.**
