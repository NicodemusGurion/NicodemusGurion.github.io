## Apostasy

How to deal with those who leave islam.

## Punishment for apostasy is death {#apostasy-death-sentence}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6922](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6922)

> Some Zanadiqa (atheists) were brought to Ali and he burnt them. The news of this event, reached Ibn Abbas who said, "If I had been in his place, I would not have burnt them, as Allah's Messenger forbade it, saying, 'Do not punish anybody with Allah's punishment (fire).' I would have killed them according to the statement of Allah's Messenger, 'Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him.'"

[Muwatta Malik 36:15](https://sunnah.com/urn/514180)

> the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If someone changes his deen (religion) - strike his neck!" The meaning of the statement of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in our opinion and Allah knows best, is that "if someone changes his deen, strike his neck!" refers to those who leave Islam for other than it - like the heretics and their like, about whom it is known. They are killed without being called to tawba (repentance) because their tawba is not recognised. They were hiding their kufr and publishing their Islam, so I do not think that one calls such people to tawba, and one does not accept their word. As for the one who goes out of Islam to something else and divulges it, one calls him to tawba. If he does not turn in tawba, he is killed. If there are people in that situation, I think that one should call them to Islam and call them to tawba. If they turn in tawba, that is accepted from them. If they do not turn in tawba, they are killed. 

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2535](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2535)

> “Whoever changes his religion, execute him.”

# Non-muslims, Jews and Christians

## Muslims should listen to and learn from Christians and Jews {#listen-to-christians}

Surah 29:46

> Do not argue with the People of the Book unless gracefully, except with those of them who act wrongfully. 

Surah 16:43;21:7

> [Prophet], all the messengers We sent before you were simply men to whom We had given the Revelation: you [people] can ask those who have knowledge if you do not know.

Surah 10:94

> If you are in doubt about what We have revealed to you, then ask those who read the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt,

Muslims should not argue with Christians but listen and learn from them what Allah has really taught.

## Jews

## Christians

### Christians must judge by the Gospel

Surah 5:47

> So let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed in it. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the rebellious.
