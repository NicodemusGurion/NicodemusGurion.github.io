# The Bible

**Note:** Muhammad was an ignoramus and did not know anything about the Bible, so when he refers to the Torah he means the Old Testament, and when he refers to the Gospel he means the New Testament.

## The Quran confirms the Bible {#bible-confirmed}

Surah 2:41

> And believe in what I have sent down (i.e. the Quran) confirming that which is with you (i.e. the Bible), and be not the first to disbelieve in it.

Surah 2:91

> When it is said to them, ‘Believe in God’s revelations,’ they reply, ‘We believe in what was revealed to us,’ but they do not believe in what came afterwards (i.e. the Quran), though it is the truth confirming what they already have (i.e. the Bible).

Surah 2:101

> Now, when a messenger from Allah has come to them—confirming their own Scriptures—some of the People of the Book cast the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know.

Surah 3:3

> He has sent down upon you the Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel

## The Torah is the word of Allah

Surah 5:43,44

> But why do they come to you for judgment when they ˹already˺ have the Torah containing Allah’s judgment, then they turn away after all? They are not ˹true˺ believers. Indeed, We revealed the Torah, containing guidance and light, by which the prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah, made judgments for Jews. So too did the rabbis and scholars judge according to Allah’s Book, with which they were entrusted and of which they were made keepers.

## The Quran says the Gospel confirms the Torah 

Surah 5:46

> Then in the footsteps of the prophets, We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah revealed before him. And We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light and confirming what was revealed in the Torah—a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing.

## The Quran confirms the Bible {#confirms-bible}

Surah 2: 88-91

> And when there comes to them a Book from Allah, **confirming what is with them**… When it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah Hath sent down, "they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us:" yet they reject all besides, even if it be Truth **confirming what is with them**…

The Quran says that it confirms "what is with them", referring to the scriptures that the Jews and Christians had in the 7th century. So according to the Quran the 7th century Bible is confirmed as authentic, uncorrupted and coming from Allah. [The problem for the liars claiming that the Bible is corrupted is that we have extant copies that are even 300](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Sinaiticus)-[900 years older than the Quran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls), and they are identical to our modern Bibles. As are all extant books and manuscripts from the 5th, 6th, 7th century and so on, showing that there has been absolutely no corruption of the meaning. This disproves the idea some Muslims put forth that the Bible has been corrupted.

## Christians and Jews must observe the Bible

Surah 5:68

> Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O People of the Book! You have nothing to stand on unless you observe the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord.” 

"People of the book" are Christians and Jews. They must observe the Torah (Old Testament) and gospel (New Testament), because these are revealed by God.

Would Allah order people to observe corrupted books? Obviously not. So these books can not be corrupted.
