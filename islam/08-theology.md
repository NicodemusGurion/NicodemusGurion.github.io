# Adam

## Adam was 60 cubits tall

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://web.archive.org/web/20240310050216/https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their form would be alike as one single person after the form of their father (Adam) sixty cubits tall.

1 Arabic cubit was traditionally 64 cm long, which means Adam would be 38.4 meters tall.








# Angels

## Angels are afraid of dogs and pictures

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4002](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4002)

> Allah's Messenger said. "Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture"



# Death

## Grieving tortures the deceased 


[Sahih al-Bukhari 1286, 1287, 1288](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1286)

> Allah's Messenger has said, 'The dead person is tortured by the crying of his relatives?"




# Hell

## Murder victims go to hell

[Sahih al-Bukhari 31](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:31)

> When two Muslims fight (meet) each other with their swords, both the murderer as well as the murdered will go to the Hell-fire.

## All people go to hell

Surah 19:71

> There is not one of you but shall pass by Hell. This is a decree which your Lord will fulfil.

So apparently all people, including all Muslims, will go to hell. It's up to the iffy and contradictory means of [salvation](#salvation) that anyone would get out of there.

[Riyad as-Salihin 1657](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1657)

> The Prophet said, "The deceased is tortured in his grave for bewailing over him."



# Jinn

## Jinn can be Muslims 

[Sunan Abi Dawud 5257](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:5257)

> In Medina a group of Jinn have embraced Islam






# The Kaaba and Qiblah {#kaaba}

The Kaaba is a black cubic temple in Mecca towards which Muslims turn to pray. It used to be a pagan temple with 360 idols in it, until Muhammad conquered Mecca in 630AD and emptied it. In one of the corners of the building sits a big black stone (or actually the fragments of a stone glued together) which Muslims reverently touch and kiss thinking that it erases their sins. This is of course blatant idolatry.

### The Muslims used to pray toward Jerusalem {#jerusalem-qiblah}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 488](https://sunnah.com/nasai:488)

> "We prayed toward Bait Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) with the Messenger of Allah for sixteen or seventeen months - Safwan was not sure - then it was changed to the Qiblah."

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4486](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4486)

> The Prophet prayed facing Bait-ulMaqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months but **he wished** that his Qibla would be the Kaaba (at Mecca). So Allah Revealed (2.144) and he offered Asr prayers(in his Mosque facing Kaaba at Mecca) and some people prayed with him.

The direction changed only because **he wished that his Qibla would be toward the Kaaba** and Allah, being [the servant of Muhammad](#allah-serves-muhammad), obliged and changed it.

At first Muhammad told them to pray toward Jerusalem because he wanted to have credibility as an Abrahamic religion alongside Christianity and Judaism. But in 624 A.D. after being rejected by the Jews and Christians in Medina, instead changed the prayer direction toward the pagan temple in Mecca to compromise with the pagan worshipers of Arabia.

Notice that since the prayer direction changed in 624, but he didn't clear out the idols in the Kaaba until 630 A.D., it means that all Muslims were praying towards a pagan temple filled with 360 pagan idols for 6 years!

## The Black stone {#black-stone}

### The black stone absorbs sins

[Mishkat al-Masabih 2577](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:2577)

> “The black stone descended from paradise whiter than milk, but the sins of the descendants of Adam made it black." 

See also: [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 877](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:877)

### Muhammad touched the black stone

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2946](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2946)

> “The Messenger of Allah did not touch the corners of the Ka’bah apart from the Black Corner (i.e., the corner where the Black Stone is) and the one that is next to it facing the houses of Banu Jumah (i.e., the Yemenite Corner).”

### Kissing the stone is idolatry

[Sahih al-Bukhari 1597](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1597)

> Umar came near the Black Stone and kissed it and said "No doubt, I know that you are a stone and can neither benefit anyone nor harm anyone. Had I not seen Allah's Messenger kissing you I would not have kissed you."

Even Umar recognized that kissing the black stone was a pointless act of idolatry, but he only did so because Muhammad did so.
