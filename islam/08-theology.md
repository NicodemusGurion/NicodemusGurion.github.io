# Adam

## Adam was 60 cubits tall

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://web.archive.org/web/20240310050216/https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their form would be alike as one single person after the form of their father (Adam) sixty cubits tall.

1 Arabic cubit was traditionally 64 cm long, which means Adam would be 38.4 meters tall.








# Angels

## Angels are afraid of dogs and pictures

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4002](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4002)

> Allah's Messenger said. "Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture"



# Death

## Grieving tortures the deceased 


[Sahih al-Bukhari 1286, 1287, 1288](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1286)

> Allah's Messenger has said, 'The dead person is tortured by the crying of his relatives?"




# Hell

## Murder victims go to hell

[Sahih al-Bukhari 31](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:31)

> When two Muslims fight (meet) each other with their swords, both the murderer as well as the murdered will go to the Hell-fire.

## All people go to hell

Surah 19:71

> There is not one of you but shall pass by Hell. This is a decree which your Lord will fulfil.

So apparently all people, including all Muslims, will go to hell. It's up to the iffy and contradictory means of [salvation](#salvation) that anyone would get out of there.

[Riyad as-Salihin 1657](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1657)

> The Prophet said, "The deceased is tortured in his grave for bewailing over him."
