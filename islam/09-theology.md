# Adam

## Adam was 60 cubits tall

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://web.archive.org/web/20240310050216/https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their form would be alike as one single person after the form of their father (Adam) sixty cubits tall.

1 Arabic cubit was traditionally 64 cm long, which means Adam would be 38.4 meters tall.








# Angels

## Angels are afraid of dogs and pictures

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4002](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4002)

> Allah's Messenger said. "Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture"



# Death

## Grieving tortures the deceased 


[Sahih al-Bukhari 1286, 1287, 1288](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1286)

> Allah's Messenger has said, 'The dead person is tortured by the crying of his relatives?"




# Hell

## Murder victims go to hell

[Sahih al-Bukhari 31](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:31)

> When two Muslims fight (meet) each other with their swords, both the murderer as well as the murdered will go to the Hell-fire.

## All people go to hell

Surah 19:71

> There is not one of you but shall pass by Hell. This is a decree which your Lord will fulfil.

So apparently all people, including all Muslims, will go to hell. It's up to the iffy and contradictory means of [salvation](#salvation) that anyone would get out of there.

[Riyad as-Salihin 1657](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1657)

> The Prophet said, "The deceased is tortured in his grave for bewailing over him."



# Jinn

## Jinn can be Muslims 

[Sunan Abi Dawud 5257](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:5257)

> In Medina a group of Jinn have embraced Islam






# The Kaaba and Qiblah {#kaaba}

The Kaaba is a black cubic temple in Mecca towards which Muslims turn to pray. It used to be a pagan temple with 360 idols in it, until Muhammad conquered Mecca in 630AD and emptied it. In one of the corners of the building sits a big black stone (or actually the fragments of a stone glued together) which Muslims reverently touch and kiss thinking that it erases their sins. This is of course blatant idolatry.

### The Muslims used to pray toward Jerusalem {#jerusalem-qiblah}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 488](https://sunnah.com/nasai:488)

> "We prayed toward Bait Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) with the Messenger of Allah for sixteen or seventeen months - Safwan was not sure - then it was changed to the Qiblah."

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4486](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4486)

> The Prophet prayed facing Bait-ulMaqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months but **he wished** that his Qibla would be the Kaaba (at Mecca). So Allah Revealed (2.144) and he offered Asr prayers(in his Mosque facing Kaaba at Mecca) and some people prayed with him.

The direction changed only because **he wished that his Qibla would be toward the Kaaba** and Allah, being [the servant of Muhammad](#allah-serves-muhammad), obliged and changed it.

At first Muhammad told them to pray toward Jerusalem because he wanted to have credibility as an Abrahamic religion alongside Christianity and Judaism. But in 624 A.D. after being rejected by the Jews and Christians in Medina, instead changed the prayer direction toward the pagan temple in Mecca to compromise with the pagan worshipers of Arabia.

Notice that since the prayer direction changed in 624, but he didn't clear out the idols in the Kaaba until 630 A.D., it means that all Muslims were praying towards a pagan temple filled with 360 pagan idols for 6 years!

### Peeing towards the Qiblah 

[Muhammad peed facing the Qiblah]{#peeing-qiblah}

### Pooping toward the Qiblah

[Muhammad pooped facing the Qiblah]{#pooping-qiblah}


## The Black stone {#black-stone}

### The black stone absorbs sins

[Mishkat al-Masabih 2577](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:2577)

> “The black stone descended from paradise whiter than milk, but the sins of the descendants of Adam made it black." 

See also: [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 877](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:877)

### Muhammad touched the black stone

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2946](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2946)

> “The Messenger of Allah did not touch the corners of the Ka’bah apart from the Black Corner (i.e., the corner where the Black Stone is) and the one that is next to it facing the houses of Banu Jumah (i.e., the Yemenite Corner).”

### Kissing the stone is idolatry

[Sahih al-Bukhari 1597](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1597)

> Umar came near the Black Stone and kissed it and said "No doubt, I know that you are a stone and can neither benefit anyone nor harm anyone. Had I not seen Allah's Messenger kissing you I would not have kissed you."

Even Umar recognized that kissing the black stone was a pointless act of idolatry, but he only did so because Muhammad did so.






# Paradise

The Islamic paradise is a very physical place where people will have sex, and eat food. But the food all tastes the same, and they will not poop, but belch out the excrement as musk.

## All fruit looks the same in paradise {#boring-fruit}

[Quran 2:25](https://quran.com/2/25)

> And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens under which rivers flow. Every time they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” for they will be given fruit that resemble one another. They will have purified spouses, and they will abide therein forever.

## Paradise dwellers don't poop but belch and sweat musk {#belching-musk}

> I heard Allah's Apostle as saying that the inmates of Paradise would eat and drink but would neither spit, nor pass water, nor void excrement, nor suffer catarrah. It was said: Then, what would happen with food? Thereupon he said: They would belch and sweat (and it would be over with their food), and their sweat would be that of musk and they would glorify and praise Allah as easily as you breathe.

## Paradise dwellers will have large-eyed houris {#houris}

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their wives will be large-eyed maidens...

## Paradise dwellers will be about 30 years old 

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2545](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2545)

> The people of Paradise shall enter Paradise without body hair, Murd, with Kuhl on their eyes, thirty years of age or thirty-three years.

- [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2539](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2539)

## Paradise dwellers will be 38 meters tall {#tall-people}

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their form would be alike as one single person after the form of their father (Adam) sixty cubits tall.

60 Arabic cubits á 64cm each equals 38.4 meters.

## Huge tree

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3252](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3252)

> The Prophet said "There is a tree in Paradise (which is so big and huge that) a rider could travel in its shade for a hundred years.

## There are 7 heavens {#seven-heavens}

Surah 2:29

> It is He Who created for you all that is in the earth, then He turned towards the heaven and made them seven heavens...





# Prayer

## Looking up while praying makes you go blind {#praying-blind}

[Sahih al Bukhari 750](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:750)

> The Prophet said, "What is wrong with those people who look towards the sky during the prayer?" His talk grew stern while delivering this speech and he said, "They should stop (looking towards the sky during the prayer); otherwise their eyesight would be taken away."

However Muhammed looked up to heaven while praying.

[Sunan Ibn Majah 1010](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1010)

> When the Messenger of Allah prayed towards Baitul-Maqdis, he would often lift his face towards the heavens.

## Raising your head before the Imam while praying turns it into a donkey head {#donkey-head}

[Sahih al Bukhari 691](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:691)

> The Prophet said, "Isn't he who raises his head before the Imam afraid that Allah may transform his head into that of a donkey or his figure into that of a donkey?"

## Prayer is nullified by donkeys, black dogs and women {#nullified-prayer}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 750](https://sunnah.com/nasai:750)

> If he does not have something as high as the back of a camel saddle in front of him, then his prayer is nullified by a woman, a donkey or a black dog."

[Sahih al-Bukhari 511](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:511)

> Narrated Aisha: The things which annul the prayers were mentioned before me. They said, "Prayer is annulled by a dog, a donkey and a woman (if they pass in front of the praying people)."

## Muslims pray to Muhammad 

This is not part of the Quran or Hadiths but it is worth mentioning since this is part of the Tashahhud, a section of the prayer that all faithful Muslims recite five times every day. In that prayer is a section that goes:

‎> ٱلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ ٱللَّٰهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ.

> as-salāmu ʿalayka ʿayyuhā n-nabīyu wa-raḥmatu -llāhi wa-barakātuhu, 

> "Peace be upon you, O Prophet, as well as God's mercy and His blessings. 

Notice that this is not talking *about* Muhammad, but *to* Muhammad. Muhammad is dead and gone, yet billions of times a day, people are addressing him as if he was alive and able to hear them. In other words this is a prayer directed toward Muhammad. Muslims are praying to Muhammad.
