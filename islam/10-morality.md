# Lying 

## Three situations in which you can lie

[Sunan Abi Dawud 4921 (Sahih)](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4921)


> I did not hear the Messenger of Allah making a concession for anything people say falsely except in three matters. The Messenger of Allah would say: I do not count as a liar a man who puts things right between people, saying a word by which he intends only putting things right, and a man who says something in war, and a man who says something to his wife, or a wife who says something to her husband.

In Islam you can lie:

1. To promote peace
2. In war
3. In marriage

These pretty much cover all of the human conditions: peaceful, non-peaceful and close relationships. Since Islam is at constant war with the non-Islamic world, a Muslim is always allowed to lie to a non-Muslim. Even Muslims are allowed to lie to one another to preserve peace, which is probably part of why Dawahists lie to Muslims about everything to keep them being Muslims. You can't even trust your spouse, your closest companion. Besides polygamy, child marriage, easy and prolific divorce, and mutah, this is yet another way Islam perverts and destroys the concept of marriage.

In other words, lying is basically permitted at any and all times for any and all reasons to any and all people, which means that you can never trust a Muslim. A religion that sanctions lying can logically not be the truth. It can only come from the Father of Lies, Satan. (John 8:44)

## You can break an oath if you have a better alternative 

[Riyad as-Salihin 1716](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1716)

> The Messenger of Allah said, "When you swear an oath and consider something else to be better than it, make expiation for your oath and do the thing that is better."

Islam is based on lies and dishonesty.







# Violence and Jihad

## Fight the unbelievers until they convert

[Sahih al-Bukhari 25](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:25)

> Allah's Messenger said: "I have been ordered (by Allah) to *fight against the people* until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and offer the prayers perfectly and give the obligatory charity, so if they perform that, then *they save their lives and property from me* except for Islamic laws and then their reckoning (accounts) will be done by Allah."


[Sahih al-Bukhari 6924, 6925](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6924)

> …[Muhammad] said: 'I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, ' and whoever said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah', Allah will save his property and his life from me…

## Fighting is the second best deed in Islam

[Sahih al-Bukhari 26](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:26)

> Allah's Messenger was asked, "What is the best deed?" He replied, "To believe in Allah and His Apostle (Muhammad). The questioner then asked, "What is the next in goodness? He replied, "To participate in Jihad (religious fighting) in Allah's Cause."


## Jihadis are rewarded with booty and paradise

[Sahih al-Bukhari 36](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:36)

> The Prophet said, "The person who participates in (Holy battles) in Allah's cause and nothing compels him to do so except belief in Allah and His Apostles, will be recompensed by Allah either with a reward, or booty (if he survives) or will be admitted to Paradise (if he is killed in the battle as a martyr). 

## Those who die for Allah are the best of people

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3106](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3106)

> Among the best of the people is a man who strives in the cause of Allah on the back of his horse, or on the back of his camel, or on his own two feet, until death comes to him.

## Whoever does not fight is a hypocrite

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3097](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3097)

> "Whoever dies without having fought or thought of fighting, he dies on one of the branches of hypocrisy."

## Killing disbelievers guarantees immunity from hell

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3109](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3109)

> Two will never be gathered together in the Fire: A Muslim who killed a disbeliever then tried his best and did not deviate.

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3116](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3116)

> Anyone whose feet become dusty in the cause of Allah, he will be forbidden to the Fire




## Even stones will help jihadists to kill Jews 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2926](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2926)

> …"The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."

## Muslims can indiscriminately kill innocent civilians 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3012](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012)

> The Prophet … was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, "They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)." I also heard the Prophet saying, "The institution of Hima (sanctuary)[^hima] is invalid except for Allah and His Apostle."

So his men, having a shred of humanity, asked about the possibility of killing non-combatant women and children. Muhammad said that it doesn't matter, they're all the same, so it's ok to kill innocent civilians. No mercy.

[^hima]: In the context of warfare in Islamic teachings, the term "hima" is sometimes used to denote a protected zone or area during times of conflict. It signifies a space where civilians and their property are safeguarded from harm. The Prophet Muhammad emphasized the importance of protecting Muslim non-combatants, including women, children, and the elderly, and avoiding unnecessary destruction during warfare. As pointed out in [Sahih al-Bukhari 3012](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012), Hima is invalid for non-Muslims though. Muslims do not need to care about innocent bystanders but can just go on killing women and children indiscriminately.

## The event that triggered Jihad {#allah-allows-jihad}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3085](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3085)

> “When the Prophet was expelled from Makkah, … it was revealed: ‘Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers) who are fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is able to give them (believers) victory.’ Then I knew that there would be fighting.” Ibn Abbas said: “This is the first Verse that was revealed concerning fighting.”

When Muhammad and his tiny band of followers were kicked out of Mecca for being a nuisance, Muhammad had a convenient revelation (Surah 23:39) where Allah gave him permission to convert his cult into the death machine that has plagued mankind since.
