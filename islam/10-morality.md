# Violence


## Jihad

See also [Violence](#violence) and [Muhammad and violence](#muhammad-and-violence).

### The goal of Islam

[Sahih al-Bukhari 25](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:25)

> Allah's Messenger said: "I have been ordered (by Allah) to *fight against the people* until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and offer the prayers perfectly and give the obligatory charity, so if they perform that, then *they save their lives and property from me* except for Islamic laws and then their reckoning (accounts) will be done by Allah."

### The second best deed

[Sahih al-Bukhari 26](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:26)

> Allah's Messenger was asked, "What is the best deed?" He replied, "To believe in Allah and His Apostle (Muhammad). The questioner then asked, "What is the next in goodness? He replied, "To participate in Jihad (religious fighting) in Allah's Cause."


### Jihadis are rewarded 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 36](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:36)

> The Prophet said, "The person who participates in (Holy battles) in Allah's cause and nothing compels him to do so except belief in Allah and His Apostles, will be recompensed by Allah either with a reward, or booty (if he survives) or will be admitted to Paradise (if he is killed in the battle as a martyr). 

### Those who die for Allah are the best of people

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3106](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3106)

> Among the best of the people is a man who strives in the cause of Allah on the back of his horse, or on the back of his camel, or on his own two feet, until death comes to him.

### Whoever does not fight is a hypocrite

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3097](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3097)

> "Whoever dies without having fought or thought of fighting, he dies on one of the branches of hypocrisy."

### Killing disbelievers guarantees immunity from hell

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3109](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3109)

> Two will never be gathered together in the Fire: A Muslim who killed a disbeliever then tried his best and did not deviate.

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3116](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3116)

> Anyone whose feet become dusty in the cause of Allah, he will be forbidden to the Fire



### The event that triggered Jihad {#allah-allows-jihad}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3085](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3085)

> “When the Prophet was expelled from Makkah, … it was revealed: ‘Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers) who are fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is able to give them (believers) victory.’ Then I knew that there would be fighting.” Ibn Abbas said: “This is the first Verse that was revealed concerning fighting.”

When Muhammad and his tiny band of followers were kicked out of Mecca for being a nuisance, Muhammad had a convenient revelation (Surah 23:39) where Allah gave him permission to convert his cult into the death machine that has plagued mankind since.
