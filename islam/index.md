# What is Dawah?

Dawah is the act of using lies and trickery to manipulate people into following Islam. To accomplish this, Muslims use a simplistic script or flow chart specifically designed to use linguistic trickery, loaded questions, false definitions, and other trickery to stump Christians and non-Christians alike. Therefore it is important to be aware of this.

# Without lies Islam dies

Always remember that Islam is an ideology of sex and violence and in order to deceive people they must use lies and trickery. So never ever take anything a Dawahists says at face value because it will me some form of lie.

# Attacking Jesus 

In Dawah scripts, the 




Anti-Dawah

Intro:

Excuse me. Do you know what the purpose of your life is?”
To a Christian:
 “Excuse me. Can I ask you a question about Jesus?
Do You Believe Jesus is God or that he was sent by God?”


Things that listener needs to accept before moving forward:

 It Would lead to a Better / Happier life in this world
 An improvement in their relationships and their children’s behaviour
 It would be like having someone very rich (e.g. Bill Gates) as your best friend
 Even the rich and famous are not happy without belief in God hence, the high levels of
drink, drugs and suicide
 In internet terms; being a Muslim is like having A Broadband Connection with God, and
simply believing in God is like having A Dial-Up-Connection with God.
 The Good News brought by The Prophets (heaven and salvation for those who believe)

How to Prove That The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) Was a True Prophet
 The Qur’an
 His life and honesty bears testament to his Prophethood.
 Allah gives him the attribute of being the guide to the worlds (Alamin, mankind, Jinn and
all creatures.)
 Previous messages were corrupted or time bound.
The Qur’an mentions Muhammad’s (PBUH) Prophet Hood (Qur’an 33:40):
Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) mentioned that he was The Last Prophet and Last Messenger. He was known to be truthful even before his claim to Prophethood.
How to Prove That The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) Didn’t Copy The Bible
The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) would have copied the errors found in the Bible? E.g.
Scientific errors.
Muhammad (PBUH) was unlettered (Qur’an 7:157) Ask them to show one single verse which is copied

To Christians:

"They believe that God is made of three personalities;"

"Christianity teaches that because Adam and Eve disobeyed God and ate of the tree (of knowledge); all of their descendants bear the sin."

"The crucifixion of a man-god i.e. Jesus on the cross paid the price of sin. Just believing in this is enough to attain salvation. To refute this ask them if Jesus wanted to die for their sins."

## If the Bible has any variation in it, it can't be from God

Muslims claim that the Quran is verbatim the words of Allah. Every single word is the word of Allah, and not a single word or letter has ever been changed.

This is a claim that Christians have **never** made about the Bible. Christians acknowledge that there are textual variants of the Bible. 

Christians claim that **Jesus** is the word of God, while the Bible text is **inspired** by God, but written down and transmitted by humans. 

There are textual manuscripts within the text that has no effect on Christian theology. There is not a single variant that contradict Christian theology. 

We don't have a problem with textual variants. We don't make the claim that the Bible has been "perfectly preserved" in the sense that not a single letter has been changed. The word of God has been preserved in the sense that it's **meaning** has been preserved. In fact you could take out entire books of the Bible and it still would not affect the meaning or theology.

So the Muslim idea of preservation does not apply to the Bible and is no problem for Christianity. However Muslims **do** have a problem with the claim that the Quran has been perfectly preserved word for word, because the Quran **has** textual variants. 


## The Bible was written by kings

The Bible was not written by kings alone. The people who wrote the Bible were shepherds, farmers, fishermen, and military men. There were kings, a prime minister, and a royal cupbearer. There was even a doctor, a tax collector, and a tentmaker among so many other people from different walks of life. 

## Muhammad taught the same message as earlier prophets

Not true. All the other prophets of the Bible, including Moses, David, and Jesus, taught that God had a temple, a priesthood, and a sacrificial system. Muhammad did not teach any of these things. The prophets of the Bible were pointing forward to Jesus as the Messiah, as God himself in human form, who would be killed as a sacrifice for the sins of the world. And Jesus also taught that he was the Messiah, God in human form, and would be killed as a sacrifice for the sins of the world. Muhammad denies all of these.

So no, Muhammad did not teach the same thing as the earlier prophets. He is a stand-alone prophet out in Arabia, teaching an entirely different message.

## X was a muslim

If you claim that any person before Muhammad was a muslim, then you base that only on the etymological origin of the word, "someone who submits to God." But that makes the word completely meaningless because the vast majority of people who has ever lived have submitted to a god. It wouldn’t signify any particular religion.

This is an etymological fallacy, word trickery. The colloquial meaning of the word Muslim is someone who follows the religion of Islam, as revealed by Muhammad. And as such there can be no Muslims before Muhammad. The Quran itself says [in 6:14](https://quran.com/6/14) that Muhammad was the first Muslim in the true sense of the word.

## Jesus was a muslim

See [X was a muslim](#x-was-a-muslim).

Jesus was a Jew who worshipped at the temple in Jerusalem. That's not the religion of Muhammad.

Jesus also taught that he is God incarnate, something Islam denies.

Jesus taught to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you. Muhammad cursed his enemies and waged war on everyone who didn't follow him.

Jesus loved children, protected them, and said that anyone who would hurt a child would be better off

## David was a Muslim

See [X was a muslim](#x-was-a-muslim).

David worshipped Yahweh as God alone in a temple in Jerusalem, under a high priest who performed sacrifices. That is the religion practiced by David. That is not the religion practiced by Kuhammad. So if David was a muslim, Muhammad was not a Muslim.
