# What is Dawah?

Dawah is the act of using lies and trickery to manipulate people into following Islam. To accomplish this, Muslims use a simplistic script or flow chart specifically designed to use linguistic trickery, loaded questions, false definitions, and other trickery to stump Christians and non-Christians alike. Therefore it is important to be aware of this.

# Without lies Islam dies

Always remember that Islam is an ideology of sex and violence and in order to deceive people they must use lies and trickery. So never ever take anything a Dawahists says at face value because it will me some form of lie.
