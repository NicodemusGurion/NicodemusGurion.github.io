## Violence against women

### Wife beating is allowed in Islam {#domestic-abuse}

Surah 4:34

> Men stand caretakers of women since Allah has made some of them excel the others, and because they have spent of their wealth., So, the righteous women are obedient, guarding in absence with the protection given by Allah. As for women whose disobedience you fear, convince them, and leave them apart in beds, and **beat them**. Then, if they obey you, do not seek a way against them. Surely, Allah is the Highest, the Greatest.

This is if a man even only fears his wife would be disobedient.

### Never ask why a man beats his wife  {#dont-question-wife-beater}

[Sunan Abi Dawud 2147](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2147)

> The Prophet said: A man will not be asked as to why he beat his wife.

[Sunan Ibn Majah 1986](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1986)

> It was narrated that Ash'ath bin Qais said: "I was a guest (at the home) of 'Umar one night, and in the middle of the night he went and hit his wife, and I separated them. When he went to bed he said to me: 'O Ash'ath, learn from me something that I heard from the Messenger of Allah" A man should not be asked why he beats his wife...

Are also [Musnad Ahmad 122](https://sunnah.com/ahmad:122)

### Flogging your wife is ok as long as you don't have sex with her afterwards

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5204](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5204)

> The Prophet said, "None of you should flog his wife as he flogs a slave and then have sexual intercourse with her in the last part of the day."

### Muhammad insults victims of domestic abuse

[Sunan Abi Dawud 2146 (Sahih)](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2146)

> Iyas ibn Abdullah ibn Abu Dhubab reported the Messenger of Allah as saying: Do not beat Allah's handmaidens, but when Umar came to the Messenger of Allah and said: Women have become emboldened towards their husbands, he (the Prophet) gave permission to beat them. Then many women came round the family of the Messenger of Allah complaining against their husbands. So the Messenger of Allah said: Many women have gone round Muhammad's family complaining against their husbands. They are not the best among you.

At first it seems Muhammad was against wife beating, but being a pushover milquetoast with no backbone, one sentence by Umar made him change his mind. Instead he started promoting wife beating and said that women who complained about being beaten were "not the best among you."


### Abu Bakr hit Aisha

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6845](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6845)

> Narrated Aisha: Abu Bakr came to towards me and **struck me violently with his fist** and said, "You have detained the people because of your necklace." But I remained motionless as if I was dead lest I should awake Allah's Messenger although that hit was very painful.

So it's ok to just go punch some other man's wife too?

### Muhammad hit Aisha


[Sahih Muslim 974b](https://sunnah.com/muslim/11/132)

Long story short: Muhammad was sneaking around outside in the middle of the night, and Aisha, thinking he was having an affair, stalks him. But he discovers her and then Sunnah.com says:

> He gave me a nudge on the chest which I felt

However the Arabic says:

>‎  فَلَهَدَنِي فِي صَدْرِي لَهْدَةً أَوْجَعَتْنِي 

[Which actually means:](https://translate.google.com/?sl=ar&tl=en&text=فَلَهَدَن%D9%90ي%20ف%D9%90ي%20صَدْر%D9%90ي%20لَهْدَةً%20أَوْجَعَتْن%D9%90ي%20&op=translate)

> He gave me a slap in the chest that hurt me

So Muhammad gets pissy and slaps his wife in the chest so hard that it hurt her. This is in harmony with Surah 4:34 which allows men to beat their wives for any reason. So I don't understand why the people at Sunnah.com feels so ashamed over this that they feel they must rewrite it to deceive people about their religion. Maybe because sane people would reject their abusive cult if they knew. Without lies Islam dies.


### No women has it worse than Muslim women {#muslimas-treated-worst}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5825](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5825)
 
> Rifa'a divorced his wife whereupon AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. Aisha said that the lady came, wearing a green veil and complained to her (Aisha) of her husband and showed her a green spot on her skin caused by beating. It was the habit of ladies to support each other, so when Allah's Messenger came, Aisha said, "I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women. Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!"…

Even Aisha, the "mother of the believers", admits that no women are treated as poorly as Muslim women. This muslima was beaten so severely that her bruises were greener than her green veil.

## Sexual abuse

### Women should be circumcised 

[Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 53:2](https://sunnah.com/adab/53/2)

> "I was captured with some **girls** from Byzantium. 'Uthman offered us Islam, but only myself and one other girl accepted Islam. 'Uthman said, '**Go and circumcise them** and purify them.'"

[Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 53:4](https://sunnah.com/adab/53/4)

> the daughters of 'A'isha's brother were circumcised

### Women are to be plowed like a field {#plowing-women}

Surah 2:223 

> Your wives are your fields, so plow into your fields whichever way you like

### Wives must always be ready to please their husbands

[Sunan Ibn Majah 1853](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1853)

> No woman can fulfill her duty towards Allah until she fulfills her duty towards her husband. If he asks her (for intimacy) even if she is on her camel saddle, she should not refuse.

### Allah curses women who don't sleep with their husbands

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5194](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5194)

> The Prophet said, "If a woman spends the night deserting her husband's bed (does not sleep with him), then the angels send their curses on her till she comes back (to her husband).

### Islam allows child marriage {#pedophilia-ok}

Surah 65:4

Context from Surah 65:1:

> O Prophet! ˹Instruct the believers:˺ **When you intend to˺ divorce women, then divorce them with concern for their waiting period**...

There's a waiting period a divorced woman has to wait before she can remarry.  

> As for your women past the age of menstruation, in case you do not know, their waiting period is three months, **and those who have not menstruated as well**. As for those who are pregnant, their waiting period ends with delivery. And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make their matters easy for them.

This means men are allowed to marry and divorce prepubescent girls.


### Temporary marriages allowed {#muta}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5075](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5075)

> We used to participate in the holy battles led by Allah's Messenger and we had nothing (no wives) with us. So we said, "Shall we get ourselves castrated?" He forbade us that and then allowed us to marry women with a temporary contract

Temporary marriage or Muta is when a Muslim man marries a woman for a few days or hours usually in exchange for money, just because he can't keep it in his pants for a few days, or he wants to sleep around without technically committing adultery. It's basically prostitution. Just yet another way in which Islam treats women as property or commodities to be bought and sold.

### Captured women's marriage annulled

[Sahih Muslim 1456 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1456)

> Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that at the Battle of Hanain Allah's Messenger sent an army to Autas and encountered the enemy and fought with them. Having overcome them and taken them captives, the Companions of Allah's Messenger seemed to refrain from having intercourse with captive women because of their husbands being polytheists. Then Allah, Most High, sent down regarding that:" And women already married, except those whom your right hands possess"

The companions of Muhammad had the basic decency to not rape married women, but then Allah said it's ok to rape married women if you capture them in battle.

## Opresive rules

### Women wearing perfume are adulteresses

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 5126](https://sunnah.com/nasai:5126)

> "The Messenger of Allah said: 'Any woman who puts on perfume then passes by people so that they can smell her fragrance then she is an adulteress.'"

### Women are cursed for plucking their eyebrows, getting tattoos, or orthodontics 

[Riyad as-Salihin 1646](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1646)

> Ibn Mas'ud (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Allah has cursed those women who practise tattooing and those women who have themselves tattooed, and those women who get their hair removed from their eyebrows and faces (except the beard and the mustache), and those who make artificial spaces between their teeth for beauty, whereby they change Allah's creation.

In Islam, [murdering people](#jihad), [lying](#taqqiya), and [raping children](#pedophilia-ok) are allowed, but if a woman plucks her eyebrows she is cursed?


## Wigs are forbidden {#no-wigs}

[Riyad as-Salihin 1642](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1642)

> A woman came to the Prophet and said: "O Messenger of Allah! I have a daughter who had an attack of small pox and her hair fell off. Now I want to celebrate her marriage. Can I get her a wig?" Thereupon the Prophet said, "Allah has cursed the maker and wearer of a wig."

Letting that poor girl go to her wedding bald, just because he had a weird thing about wigs and an obsession with micromanaging the minutiae of everyone's lives.


## General view on women 

### Most people in hell are women {#most-in-hell-women}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 1493](https://sunnah.com/nasai:1493)

> I saw Hell and I have never seen anything like it, and I saw that most of its inhabitants are women.

[Sahih al Bukhari 304](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:304)

>  Allah's Messenger … passed by the women and said, "O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women)." …

The reason for this is because Allah created women to have menstruation, meaning they can't pray and fast as much.

### Women are "deficient in intelligence"

[Sahih al Bukhari 304](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:304)

> I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence … than you.… The women asked… "What is deficient in our intelligence…?" He said, "Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?" They replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her intelligence."

See also [Sahih al Bukhari 2658](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2658)


### The testimony of a woman is worth half that of a man

Surah 2:282

> Call upon two of your men to witness. If two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice will witness—so if one of the women forgets the other may remind her.

[Sahih al Bukhari 304](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:304)

> [Muhammad] said, "Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?"

In Islam, women are considered to be half as intelligent and trustworthy as a man, therefore if two men can not be found to witness the contract, one man and two women would suffice. Apparently women are so unreliable that they need to remind one another what to say.

See also [Sahih al Bukhari 2658](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2658)

### Women are "deficient in religion"

[Sahih al Bukhari 304](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:304)

> I have not seen anyone more deficient in … religion than you. … Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses? … This is the deficiency in her religion.

See also [Sahih al Bukhari 2658](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2658)

So since women can't pray or fast during their period, they are seen as deficient. Therefore ["most people in hell are women"](#most-in-hell-women) But it is Allah who made women that way, so it is Allah's fault if this would be the case. What an absolute arsehole.

### Women are equal to donkeys, dogs and pigs

[Sahih al-Bukhari 511](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:511)

> Narrated Aisha: The things which annul the prayers were mentioned before me. They said, "Prayer is annulled by a dog, a donkey and a woman (if they pass in front of the praying people)." I said, "You have made us (i.e. women) dogs. 

[Mishkat al-Masabih 789](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:789)

> When one of you prays without a sutra, an ass, a pig, a Jew, a Magian, and a woman cut off his prayer.

### Women are a source of trouble

[Riyad as-Salihin 1675](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1675)

> The Messenger of Allah said, "There is no infection and no evil omen; but if there is anything (that may be a source of trouble) then it could be a house, a horse, and a woman."

### Women are devils 

[Mishkat al-Masabih 3105](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:3105)

> God’s Messenger [said], “A woman advances in the form of a devil and retires in the form of a devil.

### Men are not allowed to wash themselves with the same water a woman has used

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 343](https://sunnah.com/nasai:343)

> The Messenger of Allah forbade a man from performing Wudu' (washing) with the leftovers of a woman's (water for) Wudu' (washing).


### Women must cover everything but their faces and hands

[Sunan Abi Dawud 4104](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4104)

> Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin: Asma, daughter of AbuBakr, entered upon the Messenger of Allah wearing thin clothes. The Messenger of Allah turned his attention from her. He said: O Asma', when a woman reaches the age of menstruation, it does not suit her that she displays her parts of body except this and this, and he pointed to his face and hands.

Surah 23:31

> And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their chastity, and not to reveal their adornments [i.e., hair, body shape, and underclothes.] except what normally appears.[i.e., the face, hands, outer clothes, rings, kohl, and henna.] Let them draw their veils over their chests, and not reveal their ˹hidden˺ adornments [i.e., hair, arms, and legs.]
