# Minutiae 

Islam really obsesses about completely ridiculous everyday minutiae, as if God would care. Controlling your everyday behavior is a big red flag for a manipulative cult. Here are some of the most ridiculous examples.

## How to breathe while drinking

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3427](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3427) 

> “When anyone of you drinks, let him not breathe into the vessel. If he wants to continue drinking, let him move the vessel away (in order to breathe) then bring it back, if he wants.”
