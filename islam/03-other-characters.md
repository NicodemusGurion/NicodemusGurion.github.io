# Jesus

What Islam teaches about Jesus varies. Some things are more or less accurate, but many things are false, antichristian and blasphemous.

## Jesus is free of sin

Surah 19:19 

The angel said to Mary about Jesus:

> He said: I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a faultless son.

## Jesus was not crucified 

Surah 4:157

> and their saying, “We have surely killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah. ”In fact, they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them as if they had. And indeed, those who differed over him are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it—just following assumptions. And certainly, they did not kill him.

This is probably the most damning verse in the Quran, because it not only goes against the Bible and the testimony of documented history, proving that Islam is factually false and a lie, but it also leads billions of people away from salvation. 

## Jesus is Lord along with Allah

Surah 9:31

> They have taken their scholars and monks as lords besides Allāh and the Messiah, the son of Mary.

This is one of the many passages where the English translations lie to hide the meaning. The Arabic says "ٱتَّخَذُوٓا۟ أَحْبَارَهُمْ وَرُهْبَـٰنَهُمْ أَرْبَابًۭا مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَسِيحَ ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ وَمَآ" which translates as "They have taken their rabbis and their monks as lords besides Allah and the Messiah, son of Mary."

So the error of these people is to take the rabbis and monks as lords, when they already have sufficient lords in Allah AND the Messiah. So it  admits that Jesus is Lord beside Allah. 

## The First and the Last

Surah 57:3

> [Allah] is the First and the Last, and the Manifest and the Hidden, and He is All-Knowing about every thing.

Christians agree that "The First and the Last" is a title that only belongs to God. But in Revelation 1:17, Jesus uses this term to describe himself, proving that Jesus is God, and Allah is Jesus.

## King of kings

[Riyad as-Salihin 1724](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1724)

> The Prophet said, "The most disgraceful man near Allah is a man who calls himself (or likes others to call him) Malikul-Amlak (i.e., king of kings)."

Allah seemingly dislikes the King of Kinfs. But Jesus Christ is called "The King of Kings", a title that only belongs to God. So if Muslims respect Jesus they must respect his divine title.

## King of the Kingdom of Heaven and Earth

Surah 57:5

> To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And to Allah all matters are returned.

Jesus is the king of the kingdom of heaven and the earth. See John 18:36, Philippians 2:9-11, Revelation 11:15 and Daniel 7:27

## Will judge mankind

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3448](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3448)

> Allah's Messenger said, "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, surely Jesus, the son of Mary will soon descend amongst you and will judge mankind justly as a Just Ruler.

Last I checked, only God can judge humanity. Why don't Muslims follow the future king and judge of mankind?

## Is alive in heaven with Allah

Surah 3:55

> Allah said, “O Jesus! I will take you1 and raise you up to Myself. I will deliver you from those who disbelieve, and elevate your followers above the disbelievers until the Day of Judgment. 

Surah 4:157-158

> Rather, Allah raised him (Jesus) up to Himself. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.


## Jesus is the Word of Allah and a spirit from him

Surah 4:171

> The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was a messenger of Allah, and His word which He cast down to Mary, and a spirit from Him.

[Riyad as-Salihin 412](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:412)

> Jesus is His Word which He communicated to Mary and His spirit which He sent to her
