title: If God had a human form, did he have flaws?

No, Jesus had no flaws. While having a physical human body, his soul is still divine. Throughout his life, Jesus never committed any sins.

> Hebrews 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.

> Hebrews 7:26 For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.

> 1 Peter 2:22 He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.
