title: How could God enter the world as a human?
---

God has three persons: The Father, the Son (the Word of God), and the Holy Spirit. The divine person the Father is eternally in heaven. God created the universe through his Word or Son, and the Holy Spirit. 

The Son/Word is the extension of God into our world, the intermediary, the communicator.

The Holy Spirit is the spirit of God that permeates all of creation, through which the Father and Son makes things happen.

At the incarnation, the Holy Spirit entered the womb of Mary and created a perfect human being whose person is the Son/Word of God. 

Therefore the Son/Word of God is one person that is both divine and human in nature, without mixing.
