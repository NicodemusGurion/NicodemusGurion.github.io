# Elohim

**A member of the disembodied spiritual world.**

The hebrew word Elohim as used in the hebrew text simply means a spirit. The word does not indicate a specific status or role, but only what kind of being someone is. Elohim is used to describe 

* [Yahweh](#yahweh)
* The Sons of God/Divine Council
* Low ranking spirits
* Demons
* Human spirits

The word Elohim is plural (ending in -im) and in hebrew grammar plural nouns are paired with plural verbs. However when the word Elohim is paired with *singular* verbs, it signifies [Yahweh](#yahweh), the only true Elohim worthy of worship.
