# Elohim

**A member of the disembodied spiritual world.**

The hebrew word Elohim as used in the hebrew text simply means a spirit. The word does not indicate a specific status or role, but only what kind of being someone is. Elohim is used to describe 

* [Yahweh](#yahweh)
* The Sons of God/Divine Council
* Low ranking spirits
* Demons
* Human spirits

The word Elohim is plural (ending in -im) and in hebrew grammar plural nouns are paired with plural verbs. However when the word Elohim is paired with *singular* verbs, it signifies [Yahweh](#yahweh), the only true Elohim worthy of worship.

# Jehovah

**Alternative rendering of the divine name יהוה (yhvh)**

In hebrew, words were spelled using only the consonants. The divine name was spelled with the hebrew letters corresponding to YHVH. Somewhere in the second temple period the Jews became afraid of missusing God's name so they stopped using it altogether, aubstitutibg it for other words such as Adonai (Lord). Later when hebrew started using vowel pointing (little points to indicate what vowels to use), to prevent people from accidentally pronouncing the divine name when reading the scriptures, they added the vowel points for "Adonai", A-O-AI to the consonants YHVH. The idea was that the reader should see these and say "Adonai" instead of the divine name.

In the Middle Ages scholars who did not understand this practice saw the divine name with these vowel points and attempted to represent the divine name using the consonants YHWH mixed with the vowels from the word "Adonai" (A-o-ai), resulting in the hybrid form "Ya-ho-vah" or "Jehovah".

# Yahweh

**Most commonly accepted rendering of the divine name יהוה (yhvh)**

Many scholars of ancient languages and biblical studies, based on linguistic analysis and historical research, have reached a consensus that "Yahweh" is the most probable pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton. This consensus is reflected in various academic publications and translations of ancient Hebrew texts. The exact pronunciation of the divine name remains uncertain, and different scholars may have varying opinions. The rendering "Yahweh" is the most commonly accepted based on the available evidence and scholarly consensus, but it is not definitive.
