**Change:** Russell and his study associates learn that when Christ comes again he is to be invisible to human eyes and that the object of his return includes the blessing of all families of the earth

The spiritual invisible return of Christ is a false teaching adapted from Adventist teachings. Jesus was bodily resurrected and ascended to heaven in the body, and will return physically and visually. *Not a Bible teaching*.

## 1881, 1883, Elijah class

**New idea** The self-glazing idea that they like John the Baptist are a return of Elijah.

> Even before Zion's Watch Tower began to be published in July, 1879, its editor and fellow contributors were interested in Malachi's prophecy concerning Elijah. They believed that it had not been fulfilled completely in John the Baptist, but that as John the Baptist had preached the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, so there whould be a similar forerunner to precede the second coming of Jesu Christ, this time in the spirit.

> The November, 1883, issue published the article "Elijah Shall First Come" setting forth a comparison between Elijah and "The Church" and also showing that the Elijah c1ass would have to do with a later-appearing Elisha class.
