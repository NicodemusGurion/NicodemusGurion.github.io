Pliny the Younger, the Roman governor of Bithynia and Pontus (now in modern Turkey), [wrote a letter to Emperor Trajan around AD 112 and asked for counsel on dealing with the early Christian community. The letter (Epistulae X.96)](/correspondence-between-pliny-the-younger-and-trajan/) details an account of how Pliny conducted trials of suspected Christians who appeared before him as a result of anonymous accusations and asks for the Emperor's guidance on how they should be treated.

In the letter, Pliny writes this about the 112 AD Christians: 


> They asserted, however, that the sum and substance of their fault or error had been that they were accustomed to meet on a fixed day before dawn **and sing responsively a hymn to Christ as to a god**, and to bind themselves by oath, not to some crime, but not to commit fraud, theft, or adultery, not falsify their trust, nor to refuse to return a trust when called upon to do so. 

Pliny the younger has no interest in the theology of the Christians. He doesn't know they are monotheists. As a polytheist he probably doesn't even understand what monotheism is. To him, each religious group have their own god or gods, and he don't really care about the details.

But who is the god that he has understood that the Christians worship?

Jesus Christ.

When Pliny observes the Christians, he see them worshiping Jesus Christ with song.

This is evidence that the early Christians worshipped Jesus as God.
