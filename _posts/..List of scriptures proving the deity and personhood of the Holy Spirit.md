Those who question the trinity doctrine usually spend most of their time questioning [the deity of Christ.](List-of-scriptures-proving-the-deity-of-Christ) But the deity and personhood of the Holy Spirit is also questioned, so this is a list of scriptures that shows that the Holy Spirit is a person, and that he is also God. Scriptures are presented in biblical order, with comments.

# Personhood v.s. personification 

A common argument against the personhood of the Holy Spirit is that what indicated his personhood is only personification of an impersonal force.

To distinguish between the description of a real person and personifying an impersonal force or object, look for traits associated with human characteristics, emotions, or actions. Real persons are characterized by specific details, emotions, and experiences, while personification often involves attributing human qualities to non-human entities. One must pay attention to context, language choices, and whether the entity in question exhibits genuine human attributes or is merely portrayed with human-like qualities for symbolic or metaphorical purposes.

For example, the Bible calls death an enemy, calling it "the king of terrors." (1 Cor 15:21; Job 18:14) But death is never said to have emotions, speaking, thinking, acting, and so on. However the Holy Spirit shows all the evidence of personhood, including having a will, emotions, sense of self, knowledge, autonomy, authority, and so on.

# Scriptures proving the personhood of the Holy Spirit 

## Ezekiel 8 to 11

Ezekiel 8 and 11 is an amazing account where Ezekiel is transported from Babylon to Jerusalem in a prophetic vision. In this vision, notice that there are at least two agents interacting with Ezekiel who are both called Jehovah. One is the Spirit of Jehovah, the other is the Glory of Jehovah. The Glory of Jehovah is another title for Jesus. (John 1:14;Hebrews 1:3) 

The Spirit of Jehovah is described as a man of fire, taking hold of Ezekiel and carrying him from place to place. 

**"A spirit"** Note that the New World Translation is translating "the Spirit" as "a spirit" in an attempt to fudge the fact that this is the Holy Spirit.

### Ezekiel 8: 1-3 

> 1 In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting before me, **the hand of the Lord GOD (Jehovah)** fell upon me there. 2 Then I looked, and behold, **a form that had the appearance of a man**. Below what appeared to be his waist was **fire**, and above his waist was something like the appearance of brightness, like gleaming metal. 3 **He put out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head, and the Spirit lifted me up** between earth and heaven and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.

So Ezekiel is visited by the Lord Jehovah, whose hand fell on him. What he experienced is the presence of a man burning like fire. Fire is one of the attributes of the Holy Spirit. This man is tactile, because his hand grabs Ezekiel and lifts him. Ezekiel said this is "The Spirit", i.e. the Holy Spirit. And since it's the one putting his hand on him, and Ezekiel said that the hand of Jehovah came upon him, we know that the Holy Spirit is Jehovah.

- The Holy Spirit is a person
- He can have a tangible presence
- He is called The Lord/Jehovah 

Ezekiel is then transported to Jerusalem. There he sees this:

## Ezekiel 8: 4 

> And behold, **the glory of the God of Israel was there**, like the vision that I saw in the valley.

The **glory of the God of Israel was there**, and it's the same one sitting on the throne as in the first chapters of Ezekiel, meaning there are at least two agents here who are both Jehovah. 

The Glory of Jehovah is  none other than Jesus himself. (John 1:14; Heb 1:3) So in this scene, both the Son Jesus is present at a distance, and the Holy Spirit is present right beside Ezekiel, carrying him around. 

In Ezekiel 9:1,3 first the Spirit of Jehivah calls out and some men appear, then the Glory of Jehovah moves over from the distance to the threshold of the temple. In chapter 9 and 10, it is the Glory of Jehovah who issues orders to the men, then in chapter 11 the focus goes back to the Spirit of Jehovah speaking. Then in Ezekiel 11:22,23, the Glory of Jehovah lifts up from the temple and moves over to the Mount of Olives (coincidentally). Meanwhile the Spirit of Jehovah finally return Ezekiel to Babylon. (Ezekiel 11:24) So the Spirit of Jehovah and the Glory of Jehovah are two distinct agents, yet both are said to be Jehovah. (Ezekiel 9:4,5,8;10:20;11:5-21)

- The Holy Spirit and the Glory of God (Jesus) are distinct agents, both present at the same time
- Still, both are said to be Jehovah

### Ezekiel 8: 5 

> Then **he said to me**, “Son of man, lift up your eyes now toward the north.” So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of the altar gate, in the entrance, was this image of jealousy. 6 And he said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, **to drive me far from my sanctuary?** But you will see still greater abominations.”

This is the Spirit next to Ezekiel speaking. He also speaks in Ezekiel 8:8,9,12,13,15,17,18;9:1-10;10:2;11:2-21) Also he refers to the sanctuary as his place, and the Israelites are driving him away from it.

- The Holy Spirit speaks and communicates with other conscious persons. This is evidence of personhood.
- The Holy Spirit claims ownership of the temple, showing that he is Jehovah God.


### Ezekiel 11: 5 

> And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and he said to me, “Say, Thus says the LORD: So you think, O house of Israel. For I know the things that come into your mind.

In this verse the New Torld Trabslation suddenly translate it as "The Spirit of Jehovah", probably because "a spirit" would not make sense. But in doing so they make a fatal mistake that kills their doctrine. Because their translation also says "the spirit of Jehovah came upon me, **and he said to me**", which shows that the Holy Spirit 1) is a "he", a person, and 2) can speak, and command with will and authority, something only persons can. In the following verses the Holy Spirit speaks in the name of Jehovah, which shows that he is God, Jehovah.

- The Holy Spirit is a person with the pronoun "he".
- The Holy Spirit speaks and commands  with will and authority, something only persons can.
