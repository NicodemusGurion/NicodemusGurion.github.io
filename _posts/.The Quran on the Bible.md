> 2:1-3 This is the Book! There is no doubt about it — a guide for those mindful of Allah, who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and donate from what We have provided for them, and who believe in what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ **and what was revealed before you**, and have sure faith in the Hereafter.

These verses describe a follower of Islam, and itincludes believing in the unseen, establishing prayer, dontaing to charity, believing in what Mohammed taught and have faith in the hereafter. But notice the interesting part, that a muslim must also believe in **what was revealed before** Muhammed. And this includes the Bible.
