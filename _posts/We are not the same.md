A common claim by Muslims is that Islam worships the same god as Christians, or that Islam is an Abrahamic religion, or similar attempts to leech authenticity or to try to establish common ground. But we are not the same.

Here is a list of areas in which Christianity and Islam are different.

# About God

| Yahweh      | Allah |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Is triune, three persons in one being | Is simple and unitarian. |
| Is a Father |  Is Father to no one |
| Has an only begotten Son who is God in essence | Has no "partners" |
| Has a Parent-Child relationship with believers | Has a master-slave relationship with believers |
| Loves us before we know him | Only loves if we do things for him | 



| Bible | Quran |
| ----- | ----- |
| God created the heavens and the earth. | Allah created the earth and then the heavens (2:29) |
| There are 3 heavens | There are 7 heavens (2:29) |
| Hellfire is eternal | Hellfire is fueled by people and stones (2:24) |
| Hell was made for the Satan and demons | Hell was made specifically for humans |


| Adam named the animals | Allah told Adam what the animals were named (2:31) |

| God forgives sin on the basis that Jesus took the just punishment. God is just. | Allah forgives sins without a basis, making him an unjust judge |
