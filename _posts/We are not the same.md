A common claim by Muslims is that Islam worships the same god as Christians, or that Islam is an Abrahamic religion, or similar attempts to leech authenticity or to try to establish common ground. But we are not the same.

Here is a list of areas in which Christianity and Islam are different.

# About God

| Yahweh      | Allah |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Is triune, three persons in one being | Is simple and unitarian. |
| Is a Father |  Is Father to no one |
| Has an only begotten Son who is God in essence | Has no "partners" |
| Has a Parent-Child relationship with believers | Has a master-slave relationship with believers |
| Loves us before we know him | Only loves if we do things for him | 

| Loves the whole world | Hates those who don't accept Islam (q3:32;30:45)|
