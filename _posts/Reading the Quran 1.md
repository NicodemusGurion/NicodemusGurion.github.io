title: Reading the Quran, Surah 1 Al-Fatihah
tags [Islam, Quran, Reading the Quran]
---

These are my notes reading through the Quran Surah by Surah (chapter) and ayah by ayah (verse). As someone who have read and studied the Bible my whole life I naturally have a lot of context, and I quickly noticed that unless you already have a lot of theological knowledge, the Quran makes almost no sense. Someone without theological knowledge can pick up a Bible and at least follow along in the story, but with the Quran it is quite different.
Therefore I will read through it and *in italics* give my thoughts from from the perspective of someone reading it with fresh eyes, and also add my notes in regular script based on my biblical knowledge. 

Many verses are verbose so to save space I will use ellipsis ("...") to remove unnecessary text. If you want to read the full text, it is available at [Quran.com](https://wuran.com/)

My goal is to read through and cover all of the Quran.

# Al-Fatihah

The first book "The Opener" is short and mainly praises Allah.

## 1: 1

> In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.

*Right of the bat we start by introducing a character called Allah, and boast about him being awesome. Who is this and why is he so awesome. I'm sure I will get the answer.*

## 1: 2

> All praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds,

*More praise to this guy? He is apparently Lord of all worlds. Is this some sort of science fiction book? Is this some kind of intergalactic overlord?

## 1: 3 

> the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful,

*Yeah, you already mentioned that. Not a lot of imagination, eh?*

## 1: 4

> Master of the Day of Recompense.

*Ok, an intergalactic overlord who is also an accountant?*

(Allah is the Lord of judgment day. This is a title describing Jesus.)

## 1: 5

> You ˹alone˺ we worship and You ˹alone˺ we ask for help.

*Ok, so now it is addressing this Allah? Up until now I thought it was addressing me as the reader. Alright. But he is worshipped like a god and help people?*

## 1: 6

> Guide us to the straight path:

*And he guides people.*

(Muslims pray this every time they recite the first chapter. Perhaps this is why so many Muslims are converting to Christianity, or at least apostatising from Islam.)

## 1: 7

> the Path of those You have blessed—not those You are displeased with, or those who are astray.

*Allah have a rather polarised view of people, either blessing or being displeased with them. But I still have not gotten an answer to why this guy is so great? Perhaps this is one of those books that starts off strong with a puzzling scene from the middle of the story to get you hooked, and then goes "three weeks earlier..."? This Allah character is apparently an intergalactic accountant who helps people he likes but overall has a very bipolar view of people. 

# Al-Baqarah

## 2: 1

> Alif-Lãm-Mĩm.

Cryptic letters that no one knows what they means. Because the Quran is so clear and easy to understand.

## 2: 2

> This is the Book! There is no doubt about it—a guide for those mindful ˹of Allah˺,

"This is the book! Because the book said so! And it's the book, so it must be the book!" Basically "Trust me bro." It spells out the purpose of the Quran, an instruction manual. Not like the Bible which contains history, wisdom, doctrine, and specific instructions to specific people, the Quran is just a general instruction manual for all times and places.

## 2: 3

> ...donate from what We have provided for them,

Charity is important in Islam because it's a legalistic works righteousness religion, so you need ways to score brownie points. 

## 2: 4

> ...who believe in what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺and what was revealed before you...

Those who believe in Muhammad should also believe in what was revealed before him, that is the Bible and it's prophets. The Quran tells Muslims to believe the Bible, but the Muslims tells me that the Bible has been corrupted. Whom should I trust? Allah, or the Muslims who say Allah is wrong?

## 2: 7

> Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and over their sight is a veil; for for them is a great punishment.

Discussing unbelievers, it says that Allah has caused them to not believe and that therefore he will punish them. Bruh!?

## 2: 8-20

This sections discuss people who say they believe but do not.

## 2: 10

> In their hearts is sickness, so Allah increased their sickness, and for them is a painful punishment on account of how they used to lie 

Discussing fake believers, Allah is not helping them, but making their condition worse, so he can punish them. Unloving.

## 2: 18

> ... Allah took away their1light and left them in darkness(es) ,unable to see.

Again Allah is not being helpful.

## 2: 20

> The lightning almost snatches their sight(s) away; whenever it illuminates for them, they walk in it. But when it darkens over them, they stand(still) . And had Allah willed, He could have done away with their hearing and their sight(s ). Indeed, Allah is All-Powerful over everything.

It seems as though Allah likes to play a cruel cat and mouse game with deniers. Why wouldn’t he rather want to lead them into his truth?

## 2: 23

> And if youpl are in doubt about what We have bestowed upon Our servant from on high, then bring a single surah of its like, and call your witnesses apart from Allah if you are truthful.

This famous challenge is that the Quran is the word of Allah because if it's literary quality. Well, so far it has not backed up it's claim. Everything thus far has been humdrum and uninspired. The bit about the lightning was probably the highlight so far, but it's far from impressive.

Literary excellence is a really weird  condition for divine inspiration. I mean, in that case any half decent poet is more inspired than Allah and Muhammad.

But let's write a Surah better than what we've seen so far. It doesn't have to rhyme, just sound pretty. And judging from Surah 108, 3 verses should be enough. So how about this:

> The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. 
> He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. 
> Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 
> You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 
> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

How did I do?

## 2: 24

> But if you do not—and you will not—then be mindful of the Fire whose fuel is people and stones; it has been prepared for the deniers.

Apparently hell is fueled by people? And stones? In the Bible hellfire does not need fuel. Also in the Bible hell is not prepared for humans but for the satan and the demons. Humans were not supposed to go to hell but it's just an unfortunate side effect of rejecting God. But in Islam hell is made specifically to torture humans, and as we learned, Allah is deliberately causing people to go to hell. 

## 2: 25

> And give glad tidings to those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds: that for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with any produce therefrom as provision, they say, “This is what we were provided with before,” and they are brought(them) in(perfect) resemblance. And for them are cleansed spouses therein, and therein they abide.

The promise of paradise. The carrot to the stick of hell in the previous verse. The Quran gets no points for subtlety.

Notice that the fruits you get in paradise all taste the same. To be fair that sounds like a hell in itself.

And of course sex. Can't forget that sex is the central point in Islam. Even in the afterlife you need spouses. While the Bible it is said that there will be no marriage or sex in heaven, in Islam, sex in paradise is a requirement.

Tell me your religion was invented by a sex crazed horn-dog without saying me your religion was invented by a sex crazed horn-dog.

## 2:26

> Indeed, Allah does not shy away from setting forth any parable, ... He misguides many thereby and He guides many thereby, but He does not misguide thereby except the defiantly disobedient


It's interesting that Allah is said to be using parables, and whether someone understands them or not depends on whether they are humble or not. This is one of the attributes of Jesus, who used parables because the humble understands them but the proud does not. (Matt. 13:10-17; Mark 4:11,12; Luke 8:9, 10) One of many ayah that inadvertently admit that Jesus is Allah.

## 2: 27

> ... those are the losers.

Allah speaks like a 14 year old boy.

## 2: 29

> It is He Who created for you what is on earth, all together, then turned to the heaven and formed them into seven heavens...

We learn that Allah created the earth first and then the heavens, 7 of them. In the Bible God created the heavens and the earth, and there are 3 heavens.

## 2: 31 

> ...He taught Adam the names, all of them...

Assuming this means the names of the animals, this disagrees with the Bible. Adam was the one who got to give names to the animals.

## 2: 34 

> And recall when We said to the angels, “Prostrate yourselves to Adam”, so they prostrated themselves—but not Iblis1. He refused and acted arrogantly and became of the deniers.

This is an fable taken from [the apocryphal book Life of Adam and Eve 13.2](http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/anderson/vita/english/vita.lat.html).  It was written between around 100 BC-100 AD and it's an example of one of many false stories that Muhammad have just heard, thought was real, and included in the Quran. Either that or "Allah" can't tell fact from fan fiction.

## 2: 36

> Yet Satan made them slip therefrom, so he brought them out of what they were in. Then We said, “Descendpl , as enemies to one another, for in the earth youpl have a place of settlement and enjoyment for a while.”

This verse is fuzzy but it appears that after the fall, Adam and Eve "descended" from Eden, as if it was not part of earth.
