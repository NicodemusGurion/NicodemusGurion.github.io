A theophany is a visible manifestation of God to humans. The Bible is full of them. Here is a list of people who encountered God, presented in rough chronological order. Some of these saw God. Some of these even touched him or did other things together with him, like eating food. What these have in common is that they were not hallucinations, dreams, or allegorical stories, but are presented as real events happening to aware, lucid people. And they prove that humans can actually see God without dying if God allows it.

# The myth that humans can't see God

First of all, where does the myth that humans can't see God come from? The scripture I find most proponents quote is Exodus 33:20:

> But he added: “You cannot see my face, for no man can see me and live.”

But this was said to Moses at a particular event, when the Israelites were at Mount Sinai. From the context it is clear that God warned the Israelites on that day that viewing him **without his permission** coukd result in death. The immediate following verses says that Moses would see God pass by. So obviously this verse is not a universal unbreakable rule that seeing God means instant death.
