A theophany is a visible manifestation of God to humans. The Bible is full of them. Here is a list of people who encountered God, presented in rough chronological order. Some of these saw God. some if these even touched him or fidnither things together like eating food. What these have in common is that they are not hallucinations, dreams, or allegorical, but are presented as real evebts hapoening to awaie, lucid people. and they prove that humans can actually see God without dying if God allows it.
