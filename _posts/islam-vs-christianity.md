# God

| Yahweh/Jesus | Allah |
| ------- |---|
| Is love. (1 John 4:8) Loves the whole world, including unbelievers. (John 3:16) | 

# Essence of God

Allah is an absolute oneness.
Yahweh is one divine being with a plurality of divine personages.

Before creation Allah was alone. He can therefore not be love.
Before creation Yahweh was not alone. He therefore is love.


Allah is described as loving only his followers.
Yahweh is described as being love in essence.

Allah does not love unbelievers. (Surah 2:98,276;3:32)
Yahweh loves the whole world, including unbelievers.

Allah only loves if you do something for him first. (Surah 2:195;3:146)
Yahweh loves you before you even know him. (Jer 32:3;Rom 5:8;1 John 4:10,19)

Allah is absolutely transcendent.
Yahweh is both transcendent and immanent (interacting with and revealing himself directly with humans in this world).

Allah can not enter our world.
Yahweh enters our world through the op habits and ultimately through Jesus.

Allah can not be compared to any created thing and is beyond human comprehension.
Yahweh created humans in his image, and describes himself in anthropomorphic language so we can understand him.

Allah is fickle and untrustworthy.
Yahweh is unchanging and trustworthy.

# Authority 

Not every knee will bend before Allah. (Surah 48:62)
Every knee will bend before Jesus. (Phil 2:10-11)

# Fatherhood

Allah is not a father to anyone, but a slave master treating his followers as slaves. (Surah 112:4; 18:4; 19:35, 88-93)
Yahweh is a loving Heavenly Father who treats his worshipers like children.


Allah can not be a father because he has no spouse. (Surah 6:101)
Yahweh doesn't need a spouse to be a Father.

# Relationship with humanity

The relationship between Allah and humanity in Islam is characterized by submission and obedience to Allah’s will.
Yahweh’s relationship with humanity involves a covenantal personal relationship based on love, grace, and redemption through faith in Jesus Christ.

Allah guides humanity through prophets, with Muhammad being the final prophet.
Yahweh interacts with humanity through history, prophecy, and ultimately through the incarnation of Jesus.

# Sins

Allah wants people to sin.
Yahweh does not want people to sin. (Satan wants people to sin)

Allah forgives sins by overlooking them.
Yahweh can not overlook sins, but must judge righteously.


# Sonship of Jesus Christ

In Islam, the concept of Allah having a son is rejected. 
In Christianity, Jesus is considered the Son of God.

The Quran explicitly denies that Allah has any children or partners (Surah 112:3; 19:35).
The Bible teaches that God is a trinity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

# Salvation

Islam denies the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, saying that Allah deceived humanity into believing that it happened when it didn't.
Christianity and all historical evidence says that Jesus was indeed crucified.

Salvation in Islam is attained through faith in Allah, righteous deeds, and following the Five Pillars of Islam. It involves submission to Allah’s will, repentance, and seeking Allah’s mercy.
In Christianity, salvation is viewed as a gift of grace from God through faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9). It involves belief in Jesus’ sacrificial death and resurrection, repentance from sin, but can not be attained by righteous deeds.


# Holy books

The Quran took 23 years to complete.
The Bible took 1600 years to compete.

The Quran has 114 chapters and 77,797 words.
The Bible has 1189 chapters and 783,137 words.


The Quran is the literal word of Allah, unaltered and preserved in its original language.
The Bible is written by men and inspired by God's Holy Spirit.

Islam expects the Quran to be preserved word for word and letter for letter. Therefore the existence of 30+ variants is devastating to this claim. 
Christians don't expect the Bible to be preserved by the letter, but only by the theological meaning. Therefore the existence of minor variations is irellevant as they don't impact the meaning.

The Quran is said to be perfectly preserved, however several chapters have gone missing, there was several different variants already during Muhammad's lifetime, and afterward Uthman burned all variations but one.  So there is no way to confirm the original text.
The Bible is the most well preserved ancient text by many orders of magnitude. No central authority could touch it. There are tens of thousands of consistent manuscripts proving that the Bible text has not been changed for over 2300 years.

The Quran is written in Arabic, and Muslims believe that this language is somehow magical, so that you can't understand it fully unless you know Arabic. Translations are not considered real Qurans. Allah expects you to adapt to his language.
The Bible was written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Yahweh adapted to the languages that were most common in each period so that as many as possible would understand.

	
The Quran was dictated by one angel to one man, Muhammad. Allah never showed up himself.
The Bible was written by about 40 different people. Inspiration came through direct revelation from Yahweh, visions, dreams, sometimes angels, etc.

The Angel dictating the Quran is supposed to be Gabriel, but the first time Muhammad met him, he didn't introduce himself, and then violently abused Muhammad.
From the Bible we know that Gabriel always introduces himself and treats people kindly and lovingly. So whatever Muhammad met, it wasn't Gabriel.

The Quran's proof of divine inspiration is it's excellent literary quality. But experts agree that it's literary garbage.
The Bible doesn't claim proof of divine inspiration is in its literary quality, but still both it's prose and poetry has shaped the literary world.

The Quran has no verified prophecy.
The Bibly has a lot of verified prophecy.

According to the Quran, a husband can have 4 wives. He has the right to have sex with her however and whenever he wishes, and the wife does not have this right. If he even suspects her of being rebellious, he should chastise her, banish her from their bed and physically beat her. (Surah 2:223; 4:3,34)

According to the Bible, a husband may only have one wife. He and his wife have equal rights to sex. He should love her like his own body, and be willing to give his life for her. He should not be harsh with her, but show her honor and understanding as an equal, feed and cherish her, and treat her carefully like he would treat a very valuable fragile vase. If he doesn't do this, God will not listen to his prayers. (1 Peter 3:7; Ephesians 5:28-29, 33; Colossians 3:19)
