[The Quran, sura 6 verse 14 says that Mohammed was the first Muslim.](https://quran.com/6/14) So how could Jesus be a Muslim if he lived 600 years before Muhammad?

> Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Will I take any guardian other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who provides for all and is not in need of provision?” Say, “I have been commanded to be the first to submit and not be one of the polytheists.”
