Our Muslim friends often question the veracity of the Bible, but in doing so they commit kufr, denying the direct revelation of the Quran in passages such as:

# Surah 2:4 

> and who believe in what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ and what was revealed before you, and have sure faith in the Hereafter.

# Surah 2:40-41

> Children of Israel…Believe in My revelations which confirm your Scriptures.


# Surah 2:136

Say, ˹O believers,˺ “We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us; and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants; and what was given to Moses, Jesus, and other prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them. And to Allah we all submit.”

# Surah 2:285

The Messenger ˹firmly˺ believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, and so do the believers. They ˹all˺ believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, and His messengers.
