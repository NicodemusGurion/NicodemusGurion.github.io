Our Muslim friends often question the veracity of the Bible, but in doing so they commit kufr, denying the direct revelation of the Quran.

# Has the Bible been corrupted?

See the article ["The Bible has been corrupted"](/the-Bible-has-been-corrupted).

In short, we have today extant complete Bibles from the 2nd-4th century A.D., and extant complete Tanakhs (Jewish Old Testament Bibles) from the 2nd-3rd century B.C. We can compare these to modern Bibles and see that for 2300 years there has been no changes what so ever.

And the Quran repeatedly says that Allah and Muhammad affirms the authenticity, integrity, and divine origin of the Christian and Jewish scriptures that were available in Arabia in the 7th century B.C.

This means that the Bibles that Muhammad/Allah themselves affirm as uncorrupted and authoritative are identical with the Bibles we have today. No changes, no corruption.

Here are a few passages in the Quran that shows this:

# Surah 2:4 

> and who believe in what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ and **what was revealed before you**, and have sure faith in the Hereafter.

**What was revealed before you** refers to the Bible. According to the Quran, Muslims must believe in the Bible. So if the Bible is corrupted, it's impossible to be a Muslim.

# Surah 2:40-41

> Children of Israel…Believe in My revelations which confirm your Scriptures.

Allah **confirms** the **scriptures** of the  **Children of Israel**, i.e. the Tanakh, or Old Testament. 

# Surah 2: 88-91, 97-98, 100-101

> confirming what is with them

The Quran "confirms what was with them", i.e. it confirms the Bible they had in the day of Muhammad as authentic and uncorrupted. 

# Surah 2:136

> Say, ˹O believers,˺ “We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us; **and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants; and what was given to Moses, Jesus, and other prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them.** And to Allah we all submit.”

Muslims must believe in that was revealed to everyone from Abraham to Jesus. If such had been corrupted, it would be impossible to be a Muslim.

# Surah 2:285

> The Messenger ˹firmly˺ believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, and so do the believers. They ˹all˺ believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, and His messengers. 

The word "Bible" means "books", because it's a library of Allah's books. Muslims must **all believe** in "**his books**". If you are a Muslim you must believe in the Bible.



# Conclusion

As is evident, the Quran affirms that a Muslim can not be a Muslim unless they believe that the Bible is the Word of Allah, that it has been perfectly preserved, and that its contents is true and reliable. Claiming that it is unreliable or corrupted is kufr.
