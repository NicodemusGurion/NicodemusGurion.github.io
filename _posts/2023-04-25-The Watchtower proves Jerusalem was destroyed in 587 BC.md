The year 607 BCE is a pivotal year to all of Jehovah’s witnesses theology. It’s the basis for calculating the year 1914, which they teach is when Jesus returned. He then “inspected the temple” and in 1919 he chose the Watchtower as his sole representative on earth.

So if 607 B.C.E. is wrong, then 1914 is wrong. And if 1914 is wrong then 1919 is wrong. And if 1919 is wrong, the Watchtower does not have any divine authority.

So knock out 607BCE and it all comes tumbling down.

# Babylonian kings and their reigns

First if all we need the lengths of the reigns of the Babylonian kings from Nebuchadnezzar to Nabonidus. You’ll find them here:

[Nebuchadnezzar](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200003200#h=3)

Nebuchadnezzar reigned for 43 years.

[Evil-Meridach, Neriglissar and Labashi-Marduk](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1965005#h=9).

Evil-Merodach reigned for 2 years, Nerglissar reigned for 4 years, and Labashi-Marduk only reigned for 9 months, and started and ended the same year, so his reign was 0.75 years in total.

[Nabonidus/Belshazzar](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200003156#h=3)

Nabonidus reigned for 17 years, part of that time Belshazzar was his co-regent.

# When did Babylon fall?

The Neo-Babylonian dynasty fell in the year [539BCE](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200000530#h=12). This is one of the most strongly attested years in history. The Watchtower wholeheartedly agrees.

# Simple math

So the combined reign of these 5 kings is 43+2+4+0+17=66 years. 66 Year from the start of Nebuchadnezzars reign to the end of the Neo-Babylonian dynasty.

The Watchtower says [the destruction of Jerusalem occurred in Nebuchadnezzar’s 18th/19th year](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101981019#h=4). Between the destruction of Jerusalem there was 66–18 years, or 48 years. So there was 48 years between the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the Neo-Babylonian dynasty in 539 B.C.E.

So what year is 48 years before 539BCE?

539 + 48 = 587 B.C.E.

# 587, not 607

Yes, the destruction of Jerusalem occurred in 587 B.C.E., and this is just as all the history experts say. This is what thousands of clay tablets attest to. And now we proved it using ONLY Watchtower publications.

There is no way you can add it up to 607 BCE without getting gaps of up to 20 years between the kings. The Watchtower’s claim is clearly false, as proven by their own data and elementary school math.

If you don’t have 607 B.C.E you can’t have 1914 C.E. If you don’t have 1914 C.E. you don’t have any invisible coming of Jesus Christ, nor any selection of a divinely appointed “Faithful servant”. In other words, the Watchtower has no divine appointment and there is no reason for you to trust or fear them.
