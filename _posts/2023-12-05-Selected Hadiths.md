Some selected Quran and Hadith verses about everyone's favorite prophet, Mohammed.

# It's ok to marry and divorce girls who have not yet menstruated

[Surah 65:4](https://quran.com/65/4)

Context, verse 1:

> O Prophet! ˹Instruct the believers:˺ **When you intend to˺ divorce women, then divorce them with concern for their waiting period**...

There's a waiting period before a man can divorce a wife.

> As for your women past the age of menstruation, in case you do not know, their waiting period is three months, **and those who have not menstruated as well**. As for those who are pregnant, their waiting period ends with delivery.1 And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make their matters easy for them.

So men are allowed to marry and divorce prepubescent girls, as long as they respect the waiting period for divorce.

# It's ok for a man to beat his wife

> Men stand caretakers of women since Allah has made some of them excel the others, and because they have spent of their wealth., So, the righteous women are obedient, guarding in absence with the protection given by Allah. As for women whose disobedience you fear, convince them, and leave them apart in beds, and **beat them**. Then, if they obey you, do not seek a way against them. Surely, Allah is the Highest, the Greatest.

(This is if a man even only fears his wife would be disobedient.)

# Mohammed had sex with Aisha when she was 9 years old, playing with dolls

[Sunna an Nasa'i 3378](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3378)

> "The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls."

[Sahih al Bukhari 6130](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130)

> Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was **a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.**) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)

# Muhammad was suicidal and wanted to jump of a mountain

[Sahih al Bukhari 91](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/91)

> …the Prophet (ﷺ) became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear before him and say, "O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in truth" whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he had said before.


# "The eyes are the leather strap of the anus"

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 203](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:203)

> The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The eyes are the leather strap of the anus, so one who sleeps should perform ablution.

# How did Muhammad die?

## Allah promises to cut off his aorta if he tells a lie

[Quran 69:44-47](https://quran.com/69?startingVerse=44)

 >Had the Messenger made up something in Our Name, We would have certainly seized him by his right hand, then severed his aorta, and none of you could have shielded him ˹from Us˺!

[Musnad Ahmad 107](https://sunnah.com/ahmad:107)

> And if he (Muhammad ﷺ) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah). We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), And then **We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta)**, And none of you could have withheld Us from (punishing) him...”

So Allah promises that Muhammed ever acts as a false prophet, Allah will cut off his aorta.

## The lamb of Khaibar

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 4512](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4512)

> Narrated Abu Hurairah: ...So a Jewess presented him at Khaybar with a roasted sheep which she had poisoned. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ate of it and the people also ate. He then said: Take away your hands (from the food), for it has informed me that it is poisoned. Bishr ibn al-Bara' ibn Ma'rur al-Ansari died. So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess (and said to her): What motivated you to do the work you have done? She said: If you were a prophet, it would not harm you; but if you were a king, I should rid the people of you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then ordered regarding her and she was killed. He then said about the pain of which he died: I continued to feel pain from the morsel which I had eaten at Khaybar. This is the time when **it has cut off my aorta.**

- [Sunnah Abu Dawud 4510](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4510)

After Muhammad kills the whole male Jewish population of Khaibar, a Jewish woman offers him roasted lamb. Being arguably the dumbest person in history, Muhammad accepts it. And it turns out that it was poisoned. Some of his men died, but Muhammad was affected for a long time from the lingering poison. Notice that Muhammad is saying that the pain from the poison feels like it is cutting off his aorta.

## The death of Muhammed

[Sahih al Bukhari 4428](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4428)
  
> Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet (ﷺ) in his ailment in which he died, used to say, "O `Aisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, **I feel as if my aorta is being cut** from that poison."

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 4513](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4513)

> ...I do not think about the illness of my son except the poisoned sheep of which he had eaten with you at Khaybar. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: And I do not think about my illness except that. **This is the time when it cut off my aorta**...

Muhammad eventually died from the poisoned lamb of a jewish woman, and he did so while complaining that he felt as if his aorta was being cut. This is exactly how Allah said he would die if he was a false prophet.

Notice also the poetic biblical references in that a false anti-christ prophet was killed by Allah after eating of the Lamb that came from a Jewish woman.

# What was the last words of Muhammad?

[Sahih Muslim 531](https://sunnah.com/muslim:531)

>  'A'isha and Abdullah reported: As the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was about to breathe his last, he drew his sheet upon his face and when he felt uneasy, he uncovered his face and said in that very state: Let there be curse upon the Jews and the Christians that they have taken the graves of their apostles as places of worship. He in fact warned (his men) against what they (the Jews and the Christians) did.

While Jesus used his last moments to forgive his enemies, Muhammad used his last moments to curse one third of the world population.
