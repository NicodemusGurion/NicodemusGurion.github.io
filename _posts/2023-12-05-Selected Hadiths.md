Some selected Quran and Hadith verses about everyone's favorite prophet, Mohammed.

# It's ok to marry and divorce girls who have not yet menstruated

[Surah 65:4](https://quran.com/65/4)

Context, verse 1:

> O Prophet! ˹Instruct the believers:˺ **When you intend to˺ divorce women, then divorce them with concern for their waiting period**...

There's a waiting period before a man can divorce a wife.

> As for your women past the age of menstruation, in case you do not know, their waiting period is three months, **and those who have not menstruated as well**. As for those who are pregnant, their waiting period ends with delivery.1 And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make their matters easy for them.

So men are allowed to marry and divorce prepubescent girls, as long as they respect the waiting period for divorce.

# It's ok for a man to beat his wife

> Men stand caretakers of women since Allah has made some of them excel the others, and because they have spent of their wealth., So, the righteous women are obedient, guarding in absence with the protection given by Allah. As for women whose disobedience you fear, convince them, and leave them apart in beds, and **beat them**. Then, if they obey you, do not seek a way against them. Surely, Allah is the Highest, the Greatest.

(This is if a man even only fears his wife would be disobedient.)

# Mohammed had sex with Aisha when she was 9 years old, playing with dolls

[Sunna an Nasa'i 3378](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3378)

> "The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls."

[Sahih al Bukhari 6130](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130)

> Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was **a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.**) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)

# Muhammad was suicidal and wanted to jump of a mountain

[Sahih al Bukhari 91](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/91)

> …the Prophet (ﷺ) became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear before him and say, "O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in truth" whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he had said before.


# "The eyes are the leather strap of the anus"

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 203](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:203)

> The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: The eyes are the leather strap of the anus, so one who sleeps should perform ablution.
