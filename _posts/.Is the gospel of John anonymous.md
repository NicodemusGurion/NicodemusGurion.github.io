The four gospels of the Bible have been attributed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John since the start of the history of Christianity. Historically no one has disputed these authors. However some people claim that the authors are anonymous because they do not present themselves in the text itself.

This article deals specifically with the gospel of John and how we can prove that the apostle John is the author just by looking at the text itself.

## The author of the gospel of John was Jewish

This point is rarely disputed. The author made many references to Jewish beliefs and scriptures. He alludes to the Old Testament some 20 times. He makes unexplained references to "The Prophet" that would come (John 1:21,25; John 6:14; John 7:40). He speaks about the hostility between the Jews and Samaritans. (John 4:29) He speaks about specific laws regarding circumcisions and the sabbath. (John 7:22) He speaks about the belief that the Measiah will live forever. (John 12:34; Isaiah 9:7) 

These are things that it is unlikely that a non-Jew would know or even care about. So we can safely conclude the author was Jewish.

## The author was a native of Israel

In John 2:11,12 there's a trip from Cana to Capernaum that is described as going "down". Cana is about 200 meters above sea level and Capernaum is about 200 meters below sea level. 

John 4:46;5:1 describes how Jesus went "up" from Cana to Jerusalem. Jerusalem has an elevation of 785 meters above sea level. 

In John 11:18 Bethany is described as being 15 stadia (1.7 miles/2.77km) from Jerusalem, which is accurate.

Accuracy in such details shows that the author is a local who is familiar with the topography and geography of the area.

In John 5:2 the author describes the pool of Bethesda which had 5 colonnades. When archaeologists excavated it, this turned out to be true, meaning the author had accurate knowledge of this place.

In John 10:23 he describes the colonnade of Solomon. Since the temple of Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 AD, whoever wrote these details must have been someone who lived before 70 AD. 

In John 6:1 he refers to the Sea of Galilee as the Sea of Tiberias, which was a local unofficial name for it. (John 6:1)  This is something only a local would be likely to know and use. Getting this kind of information would be almost impossible for someone who was an outsider. 

So we can conclude that the author of the gospel of John was a local who lived in the area of Israel before 70 AD and had accurate knowledge of place names, geography and topology.

## The author was an eyewitness

In John 21:24, the author claims to be a truthful eyewitness. This is evidenced by the accurate details he writes down.

If the gospel was just a later recording of oral stories then a lot of seemingly irrelevant details would fall away with time, because they would not seem to be important to the story.

However, the author knows many specific details only an eyewitness would know.

For example, he knows specific information about random people. He is the only one who mentions people like Nicodemus, Lazarus, Judas' father Simon, or Malchus, the slave of the high priest. (John 3:1;6:71;18:10) 

The author mentions oddly specific details that don't seem to be all that important to the story. For example:

- That there were 6 water pots when Jesus turned water into wine. (John 2:6) 
- That it took 46 years for the temple to be built. (John 2:20) 
- That the Samaritan woman had had 5 previous husbands. (John 4:18)  
- That the paralytic was paralyzed for 38 years. (John 5:5) 
- The disciples rowed for 25-30 stadia before they saw Jesus walking on water. (John 6:19) 
- That Lazarus was dead for 4 days.(John 11:17)  
- That Mary's perfume was worth 300 denari. (John 12:5) 
- That the disciples caught 153 fish. (John 21:11) 
- That the loaves Jesus used to feed 5000 people were barley loaves. (John 6:9) 
- That the fire Jesus warned himself by was a charcoal fire. (John 21:9) 
- That Jesus' tunic was seamlessly woven. (John 19:23) 
- That Jesus came to Bethany 6 days before the Passover. (John 12:1) 
- The time of day when the disciples of John the Baptist started following Jesus (John 1:39)
- The time of day a slave was miraculously healed. (John 4:52) 
- The time of day Jesus was taken away to be crucified. (John 19:14)

Recording things in such detail would make very little sense if the story was made up or the product of oral tradition, where specific and unnecessary details fall away with retelling. They indicate that this account was written by someone who was actually there and saw things with their own eyes. An eyewitness.

## The author was one of the 12 disciples

He is familiar with scenes where only the 12 were present. Their calling, their trip to Samaria, their reactions, their thoughts, their feelings, what they said to Jesus, what they said amongst themselves, their misunderstandings, even where Jesus would go to avoid people. Such vivid details could only be known by someone in the inner circle, one of the apostles. 

## He is "the Beloved Disciple"

In John 21:20-24 it says that the author of the gospel of John called himself by the alias "the disciple whom Jesus loved", or "the Beloved Disciple." Modest or immodest, this alias gives us a way to know who is the author. 

Mark 12:17 says that *only the 12 apostles* joined Jesus during the last supper, and *the Beloved Disciple was present at the last supper*. (John 13:23-35) So he is definitely one of the 12 apostles.

We just take a list of the 12 disciples and eliminate anyone who can not be the Beloved Disciple, and whoever is left is the author.

This is a list of the 12 disciples:

*   Simon Peter
*   Andrew
*   James the son of Zebedee
*   John the son of Zebedee
*   Philip
*   Nathanael Bartholomew
*   Thomas
*   Matthew/Levi
*   James the son of Alphaeus/The Lesser
*   Judas Thaddaeus/Son of James
*   Simon the Canaanean/Zealot
*   Judas Iscariot

From this list we can immediately exclude Judas Iscariot, because he killed himself before the story was even finished.

We can also exclude Simon Peter. John 20:2; 21:7,20 shows that these are two different persons.

We can exclude James the son of Zebedee, because he was martyred by Agrippa in 44AD, decades before the gospel was written


In John 21:20-24 the Beloved Disciple was one of 7 disciples on a fishing tour in Galilee. (John 21:7) Among these are named Peter, Thomas, Nathanael, the sons of Zebedee (James and John) and two unnamed fishermen.


and two others of his disciples not mentioned by name. 7 in total. Who are these two others not mentioned by name? The only other disciple not mentioned here whom we know was a fisherman was Andrew the brother of Peter. (Matthew 4:18) We know that Philip was a close friend of Nathaniel, Andrew and Peter who were all from the same home town of Bethsaida. (John 1:43-45; John 12:21,22) So it is highly likely Philip was also a fisherman and thus this unnamed disciple is likely Philip. The other unnamed apostle could not been Judas Iscariot who was dead. It was likely not Matthew who was a tax collector and not a fisherman. It was probably not Simon the Zealot, because he presumably used to be a politically active Zealot in the fight against Rome and therefore unlikely to have a background as a fisherman. It was likely not James the son of Alpheus because we basicaly know nothing about him as he is never even mentioned outside of the name lists. Of the people mentioned in this account we can exclude James the son of Zebedee, because he was martyred by Agrippa in 44AD, decades before the gospel was written. We can also exclude Peter, because in John 21:20 he talks about TDJL. So the only possibilities left for the identity of the author are:

*   Thomas
*   Nathanael
*   John
*   Andrew
*   Philip

## The Last Supper

During the last supper The Author refers to himself as The Disciple whom Jesus Loved. (John 13:23) Ironically this anonymity can help us reveal his identity. Since he never refers to himself by name, we know that when he is mentioning someone _else_ by name and he himself is present he is not talking about himself. So any other disciple who is also present at the last supper can be removed from the list:

*   Peter is named, speaking to TDJL (John 13:23,24)
*   Thomas is there. (John 14:5)
*   Philip is there (John 14:8)
*   Judas Thaddeus is there (John 14:22)

This shortens our short list of possibilities to:

*   Nathanael
*   John
*   Andrew

## The gang of three

In John 19:26,27 The Author/TDJL joins Mary at the crucifixion and is given the responsibility to take care of her.  No small task that you'd give to any random person, but only to a very near and trusted friend. So whom did Jesus consider his closest friends? In many instances the group of the apostles seem to have an inner core group of three people: Peter, James and John. These are not only among the first disciples, but are also often mentioned together getting special tasks and privileges, like following Jesus up on the high mountain and witnessing the transfiguration (Matthew 17:1; Mark 9:2; Luke 9:28), witnessing the resurrection of Jairus' daughter (Mark 5:37; Luke 8:51), asking Jesus about the future (Mark 13:3) and being close to Jesus when he prayed on his final night (Mark 14:33). They were also later called the "pillars" in the Jerusalem congregation. (Galatians 2:9) So it was clear that these three were closer to Jesus than anyone else. It would be really strange if the beloved disciple to whom Jesus entrusted the care of his mother would not also be one of his inner group of disciples. That would exclude Andrew and Nathanael, (as well as Matthew, James the less, and Simon the Zealot) and leave only John the son of Zebbedee.

## Never mentioning John the apostle

Speaking of being anonymous, the only apostles the Author never mention by name are James and John, always calling them the Sons of Zebbedee. Why is that? Why does he make such effort to only conceal the name of John while making up a special title for himself? (By the time the gospel is written, James was already dead.) I put it to you that it is a modest way of indicating who the author is.

## Conclusion

The internal evidence of the gospel of John, in harmony with corroborating evidence from the other gospels, show that the Disciple whom Jesus loved, who is also the author of the Gospel, is John the son of Zebedee.
