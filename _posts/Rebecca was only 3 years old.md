title: \"Rebecca was only 3 years old when Isaac married her\"

This is a common claim by Islamic Dawah people, and it is of course completely false.

The argument goes that Isaac was born when his mother was 90, and his mother Sarah died at the age of 127, when Isaac was 37 years old. (Genesis 17:17;21:2-5;23:1) Before she died,  Genesis 22:20-24 mentions that Bethuel became father to Rebecca. And since Isaac was 40 when he married Rebecca, this would mean Rebecca was only 3 years old when Isaac married her. (Genesis 25:20)

This is of course full of inaccuracies and false assumptions.

# We don't know the interval between Genesis 22 and 23

First of all, we do not know the interval between the events in Genesis 22 and 23. Sometimes the narrative jumps years or decades.

We know that in Genesis 21, Isaac was weaned, which might mean he was around 3-6 years old. And in Genesis 23, Isaac is arguably 37 years old. So the events in Genesis 22 could have happened anywhere between those ages. We know that Isaac was a strong young man when God tested Abraham. But we can't say he was 37 years old.

Notice that in Genesis 22:19, they are living in Beer-Sheba. But in Genesis 23:2, they are living in Hebron when Sarah dies, a distance of 65km. This signifies that the events are not close in time but that a lot of things have happened in the meantime. This alone invalidates the argument.

# News didn't travel instantly

In Genesis 22:20-24, Abraham gets news about what has happened with his family. At this point he has not seen his family for at least around 45 to 62 years! (Genesis 12:4) Apparently some unnamed traveler came his way who knew both him and his family, and he summarized what had happened since last. In total, 14 people had been born in the last 45-62 years, among them Rebecca. So it's unreasonable to conclude that Rebecca was born the same day that traveler left home. She had been born for a while, long enough to be well known as a person.

# Rebecca was a woman

# Rebecca was strong

# Christians don't follow Isaac as an example
