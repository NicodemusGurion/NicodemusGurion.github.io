[Eisegesis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisegesis) (/ˌaɪsɪˈdʒiːsɪs/) is **the process of interpreting text in such a way as to introduce one's own presuppositions, agendas or biases**. It is commonly referred to as "reading into the text". The opposite of this is [exegesis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exegesis),  which is to read and interpret a text based on its internal context, without our external biases. 

When someone says something like "we only believe what the Bible teaches" this actually means nothing, because unless you use proper exegesis, understanding the contexts, you can make a big text like the Bible say anything. 

Here is an example:

God is a fire.
--------------

Did you know that God is actually fire? Pure, holy fire. Don't believe me? Well, it is based **only** on what the Bible teaches.

> Hebrews 12:29 For our God is a consuming fire. 
> Deuteronomy 4:24 For Jehovah your God is a consuming fire, a God who requires exclusive devotion.

The Bible directly teaches that Jehovah God, the most high, is a consuming fire. (See also Psalm 50:3) 

### How God appears to people 

> Exodus 3:2 Then Jehovah’s angel appeared to him in a flame of fire in the midst of a thornbush. As he kept looking, he saw that the thornbush was on fire, and yet the thornbush was not consumed. 

> Exodus 24:17 To the Israelites who were watching, the appearance of Jehovah’s glory was like a consuming fire on the mountaintop. 

> Deuteronomy 9:3 Therefore, you should know this day that Jehovah your God will cross ahead of you. He is a consuming fire, and he will annihilate them. He will subdue them before your eyes so that you may quickly drive them out and destroy them, just as Jehovah has promised you. 

> Deuteronomy 4:12 And Jehovah began to speak to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words, but you saw no form—there was only a voice. 

> Deuteronomy 5:24-36 Then you said, ‘Here Jehovah our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the fire. Today we have seen that God can speak with man and he can keep living. 25 Now, why should we die? For this great fire may consume us. If we continue hearing the voice of Jehovah our God, we are sure to die. 26 For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the fire as we did and yet goes on living?   

### Holy Spirit 

> Revelation 4:5 From the throne were coming lightning and voices and thunders; and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, and these mean the seven spirits of God. 

### Punishment 
 
> Leviticus 10:2 At this a fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed them, so that they died before Jehovah. 
> Psalm 29:7 The voice of Jehovah strikes with flames of fire; 
> 1 Kings 18:24 Then you must call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Jehovah. The God who answers by fire will show that he is the true God.” To this all the people answered: “What you say is good.” 
> 1 Kings 18: 38 At that the fire of Jehovah fell from above and consumed the burnt offering, the pieces of wood, the stones, and the dust, and it licked up the water from the trench. 
> 2 Kings 2:12 But E·liʹjah answered them: “If I am a man of the true God, let fire come down from the heavens and consume you and your 50 men.” And fire of God came down from the heavens and consumed him and his 50 men. 
> Revelation 14:10 he will also drink of the wine of the anger of God that is poured out undiluted into the cup of His wrath, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb. 
> Revelation 18:8 That is why in one day her plagues will come, death and mourning and famine, and she will be completely burned with fire, because Jehovah God, who judged her, is strong.
