title: Is God lying in these scriptures?

Numbers 23:19 says "God is not human, that he should lie", Hebrews 6:18 says "it is impossible for God to lie" and Titus 1:2 says "God, who does not lie". It seems pretty clear that God is not a liar. But there are some scriptures that seem to question this assumption. We'll look at some examples of places where it may look like God is lying, but let's examine them closer.

## Some context

It is not unusual that God uses his enemies as pawns to carry out his purposes. Like in the case of Pharaoh where Pharaoh kept hardening his heart, so finally when Pharaoh was beyond redemption, God started helping Pharaoh harden his heart. But this only ever happens after they have repeatedly been unrepentant and have proven that they are enemies who will not change. If a person is so hell-bent on going away from God, then God says ”Fine, go your way!” and lets him go his own way. (Rom 1:24,26,28) And God can even give him a helping hand in doing so. Also Deuteronomy 18:20-22 tells us that the difference between a true and false prophet is whether their prophecy comes true. So when using false prophets as pawns, it would be a logical thing of God to make sure that their prophecies are false, so that people do not mistake them for true prophets. First let's look at how God treats his enemies, then his friends.

# False prophets and enemies of God

## 1 Kings 22:23 / 2 Chronicles 18:22 (Same story)

> Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.

God sent a lying spirit to false prophets. What is a lying spirit? Some argue that this spirit was the satan or some fallen angel that God allowed to go entice these kings. It could also be argued that it was a holy angel on a mission to carry out the will of God, that the king should die. In either case, it is not an example of God lying, but an example of God using the confusion of his enemies to carry out his will. These false prophets listened to lying spirits all the time, so what is one more to cause confusion? In verse 21 the spirit says ”I will entice him” and in verse 22, God also uses the same word. This is the Hebrew word Pata, which is used to flirt, entice, tempt. It does not mean to lie. In this case it means God used the inclination of the king’s heart to give the king what he wanted, an answer he liked. But as the story shows, the king did not seek God, in fact he hate the prophet of the True God who told him the truths from God. In the end the result was a dead evil king, a vindicated true prophet of God, the false prophets proven false and God glorified. And no lie was told.

## 2 Thessalonians 2:11

> And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.

This talks about the time period during the Tribulation where the Antichrist, the man of Lawlessness appears.If you look at the context. When you see the word ”therefore” you should always ask ”what is it there for?”

> 2 Thessalonians 2:8-12 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming. 9 The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders, 10 and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. 11 Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, 12 in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.

These people who are perishing refused to love the truth and be saved. They rejected God. These people are ready for the deception of the Antichrist. **THEREFORE**, God sends a strong delusion. It doesn’t say he is lying. God has judgment to bring, and He will send a strong delusion through the Antichrist. God will not force this delusion on anyone, but those who do not receive the love of the truth will receive this strong delusion. So these people will accept the Antichrist, who will deceive them with signs and wonders and with all wicked deception.

## Ezekiel 14:9

> And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.

Ezekiel also use the word Pata, which does not mean to lie, but to entice or tempt. This hypothetical prophet is also a false prophet and enemy of God. As such he is not entitled to an accurate prophecy from God. But God will ensure that he is revealed and destroyed as a false prophet in accordance with Deuteronomy 18:20-22

# To faithful prophets:

## Jeremiah 4:10

> Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reaches unto the soul.

This verse is just a rhetorical emotional outburst and doesn’t tell us anything about whether God is lying or not. Jeremiah was a man of passionate emotions. In one verse he can be happy as a clam, and in the next depressed and lamenting. In this verse, after God has started declaring woes, without thinking Jeremiah bursts out asking if God has not deceived the people? Because at that time the people lived in expectations of peace. But in fact it was the false prophets who had deceived them into thinking that peace was certain. God never said that they would have peace. In fact this is what God repeatedly said:

> **Jeremiah 23:16-17** Thus says the LORD of hosts: “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, filling you with vain hopes. They speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD. 17 They say continually to those who despise the word of the LORD, ‘It shall be well with you’; and to everyone who stubbornly follows his own heart, they say, ‘No disaster shall come upon you.’”

## Jeremiah 20:7

> O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.

Jeremiah use the word Pata here too. He means that God has enticed him, kind of how like a young man entices a young woman and then leaves her with shame Jeremiah felt as if God had sent him to prophesy and then left him to be mocked by the people. It doesn’t mean God have told him any lies or anything that is false.
