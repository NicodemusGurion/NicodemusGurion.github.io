John 17:3 is often used as an argument against the trinity doctrine by Arians like Jehovah's Witnesses. The argument is that since it mentions the one true God, as well as Jesus Christ, then Jesus Christ can not be the one true God.

Also the way the scripture is translated in the New World Translation, it makes it sound like eternal life is a result of learning about God. This would be an example of works-righteousness.
