A chapter by chapter list of scriptures in the gospel of Mark that shows the divinity of Jesus Christ.

> Mark 1:1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

Claiming to that Jesus is the Son of God is already a high Christology, claiming divinity or equality with God as a Son is equal in nature to his Father.

> Mark 1:2 As it is written in Isaiah the prophet “Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare **your way,** ”

Mark quotes Malachi 3:1 (which was part of the Isaiah scroll in old times), but he changes it a bit. Malachi says "Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way **before me**."  In Malachi, it is God himself speaking. God is the one who is coming to the temple. But Mark writes "your way" as if the one spoken to is Jesus. Jesus is the one who comes to the temple. So Mark applies this verse to the coming of Jesus, which is a very straightforward way of saying that Jesus is God coming to visit his people.

> Mark 1:3 the voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, **make his paths straight’**

In verse 3 Mark writes "make his paths straight". This is a quote or paraphrase from Isaiah 40:3 which says "A voice of one calling: “Prepare the way for the LORD in the wilderness; **make a straight highway for our God** in the desert." But Mark changes it to "make his path straight" referring to Jesus. Mark is making a straightforward point that Jesus is God as mentioned in Isaiah 40:3.

> Mark 1:23-24 And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, 24 “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--**the Holy One of God**.”

The phrase Holy one of God does not appear in the canonical Old Testament text, however the first century Jews lived in a context where other texts were circulating and influencing their worldview, such as the book of Enoch. Jude 1:14,15 quotes the book of Enoch for example. The book of Enoch talks a lot about the fallen angels and the demons. So what this demon says could be a reference to Enoch 1:3-5:

> **[Enoch 1:3-5](http://www.ccel.org/c/charles/otpseudepig/enoch/ENOCH_1.HTM) - **Concerning the elect I said, and took up my parable concerning them: **The Holy Great One** will come forth from His dwelling, 4 And **the eternal God will tread upon the earth, (even) on Mount Sinai**, [And appear from His camp] And appear in the strength of His might from the heaven of heavens. 5 And all shall be smitten with fear And the Watchers shall quake, And great fear and trembling shall seize them unto the ends of the earth.

The Holy one of God would to the first century Jewish mind be a title of divinity. To be continued...
