Some selected Quran and Hadith verses.

[TOC]

<small> Note that there are many translations of the Quran and few of them are honest. Most of them paraphrase, add, remove, and change words to make it seem more palpable to westerners. For example, surah 4:34 says that men can "strike" their wives, but the Clear Quran renders this "discipline them gently". Or surah 1:157 which says that "Allah prays" (salawatun, from salat, pray), they change it to "blesses". As the saying goes "without lies Islam dies". If you don't expect honesty from Islamic scholars you will usually be right. </small>

<small>Unless otherwise mentioned hadith quotations are from Muhammad. Since the hadiths are often verbose, ellipsis (…) has been used to cut down on the volume of text; See original Hadiths for full text. </small>

# Adam

## Adam was 60 cubits tall

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their form would be alike as one single person after the form of their father (Adam) sixty cubits tall.

1 Arabic cubit was traditionally 64 cm long, which means Adam would be 38.4 meters tall.
 
# Allah

## Allah prays

Surah 2:157

> Upon those are the prayers *from* their Lord, and mercy; and those are they (who) are the right-guided.

[Quran 33:43, 56 Palmer](https://sacred-texts.com/isl/sbe09/033.htm)

> He it is who prays for you and His angels too, to bring you forth out of the darkness into the light, for He is merciful to the believers. …  Verily, God and His angels pray for the prophet. O ye who believe! pray for him and salute him with a salutation!

[Al Adan Al Mufrad 645](https://sunnah.com/adab:645)

> [Muhammad] said, "If anyone prays once on me, Allah will pray ten times on him.'"

Who is Allah praying to?

## Allah is a narcissist 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4634](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4634)

> And none loves to be praised more than Allah does, and for this reason He praises Himself.

## Allah wonders 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3010](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3010)

> The Prophet said, "Allah wonders at those people who will enter Paradise in chains."

Apparently there are things that surprise Allah. How could someone supposedly all-knowing wonder about anything?

## Allah is limited to one location

Surah 20:5

> the Most Compassionate, Who is˺ established on the Throne.

Allah sits on a throne in heaven.

## Allah comes down every night

[Sahih Muslim 758b](https://sunnah.com/muslim:758b)

> Allah descends every night to the lowest heaven when one-third of the first part of the night is over (3 am) and says: I am the Lord; I am the Lord: who is there to supplicate Me so that I answer him? Who is there to beg of Me so that I grant him? Who is there to beg forgiveness from Me so that I forgive him? He continues like this till the day breaks.

Allah doesn't know how time zones work. If he comes down every night at  3am, and leave at daybreak, in what time zone is he? It would mean that in one time zone he is descending while in another time zone he is ascending, at the same time. Therefore Allah is always somewhere in our atmosphere at all times, yet he is unable to enter our world, and he is [also located on his throne?](#allah-is-limited-to-one-location) How does it work?

## Allah deceives

Surah 8:43-44

> Recall: Allah showing them to you in your sleep as few, for had He showed them to you as many, you would have faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter, but Allah saved (the situation). He is indeed All-Knowing of what lies within the chests. And recall: when you met, Him showing them to you as few in your eyes and making you appear fewer in their eyes, so that Allah might carry out a predetermined matter. And to Allah all matters are returned.

Allah deceived Muhammad to go into battle against a large army, making him think it was a small army. He also deceived his enemies in the same way.

Surah 4:157

> and their saying, “We have surely killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah. ”In fact, they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them as if they had. And indeed, those who differed over him are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it—just following assumptions. And certainly, they did not kill him.

Allah deceived the Jews and Romans into thinking they killed Jesus. Allah is deceptive.

This is also a verse that proves Islam is historically false, for [the crucifixion of Jesus is the most well documented event in ancient history.](#no-crucifixion)

## Allah wants people to sin

[Sahih Muslim 2749](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2749)

> By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if you were not to commit sin, Allah would sweep you out of existence and He would replace (you by) those people who would commit sin and seek forgiveness from Allah, and He would have pardoned them.

## Allah has predestined adultery

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6612](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6612)

> Allah has written for the son of Adam his inevitable share of adultery whether he is aware of it or not

[Sahih Muslim 2657 b](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2657b)

> Allah has fixed the very portion of adultery which a man will indulge in, and which he of necessity must commit.

## Allah pampers Muhammad

[Sahih al Bukhari 4788](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4788)

> I said (to the Prophet), "I feel that your Lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires."

Even Aisha noticed that the "revelations" that Muhammad got from Allah was suspiciously self-serving, affording him all sorts of luxuries and privileges. For example he was the only one who could take more than 4 wives, he could use his female slaves as sex slaves without his wives being able to complain, could steal his adoptive son's wife, and Allah even instructed people how to handle dinner parties at his place, because Muhammad was too shy to tell people himself. It seems like every time Muhammad had any desire, Allah came with a convenient revelation permitting him to go ahead.

# Animals

## Owning a dog gives you minus points {#owning-a-dog}

[Sahih al Bukhari 5480](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5480)

> "Whoever keeps a (pet) dog which is neither a watch dog nor a hunting dog, will get a daily deduction of two Qirat from his good deeds."

# Apostasy 

## Punishment for apostasy is being stoned to death {#apostasy-death-sentence}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2535](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2535)

> “Whoever changes his religion, execute him.”

- [Sunan Ibn Majah 2533](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2533)
- [Sunan Ibn Majah 2534](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2534)

# Contradictions

Surah 4:82

> Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Had it been from anyone other than Allah, they would have certainly found in it many inconsistencies.

If the Quran is from Allah, there should be no contradictions.

## How long did it take Allah to create the world?

Was it 6 days or 8 days?

Surah 10:3 says Allah created the heavens and the earth in 6 days.

> Surely your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days,...

Surah 41:9-12 says Allah created the heavens and the earth in 8 days. 2 + 4 + 2 = 8. 

> Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “How can you disbelieve in the One Who created the earth in **two Days**? And how can you set up equals with Him? That is the Lord of all worlds. He placed on the earth firm mountains, standing high, showered His blessings upon it, and ordained ˹all˺ its means of sustenance—totaling **four Days** exactly —for all who ask. ... So He formed the heaven into seven heavens in **two Days**, assigning to each its mandate. ... 

## Muhammad did and did not do miracles 

In Surah 6:37; 6:109; 13:7; 17:59; 20:20 it says that Muhammad never did any miracles. But in [Sahih al Bukhari 3637](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3637) it says that he DID do a miracle.

## Are people ransomed from hell or not.

[The Quran says there will be no ransoms whatsoever on judgment day.](#no-ransom) But one Hadith says [muslims will be ransomed from hell by Christians and Jews taking their places in hell.](#ransomed-from-hell).

# Errors 

Historical and factual errors 

## Jews think Ezra is the son of Allah {#ezra-son-of-allah}

Surah 9:30

> The Jews say, “Ezra is the son of Allah,” …

This is false. No Jews have ever claimed that Ezra is the son of God. Is it Allah or Muhammad who is ignorant of this fact?

## Christians worship Mary {#worshipping-mary}

Surah 5:116

> And ˹on Judgment Day˺ Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Did you ever ask the people to worship you and your mother as gods besides Allah?”...

Christians don't worship Mary. But Allah doesn't know this.

## Mary the mother of Jesus is the brother of Aaron {#who-is-mary}

Surah 19:27-28

> Then she returned to her people, carrying him [Jesus]. They said ˹in shock˺, “O Mary! You have certainly done a horrible thing! O  sister of Aaron! Your father was not an indecent man, nor was your mother unchaste.”

Mary the mother of Jesus lived in first century Judaea/Galilee. Mariam the sister of Aaron lived about 1500 years before her in Egypt/Sinai. Allah does not know that these are two different people.

## Pharao ordered Haman to build the Tower of Babel {#pharao-haman-tower}

Surah 40:36

> Pharaoh ordered, “O Hamân! Build me a high tower so I may reach the pathways leading up to the heavens and look for the God of Moses, although I am sure he is a liar.” …

The Pharao was the king of Egypt. Haman was an Amalekite man, an enemy of Israel, who lived in the Persian empire in the 5th century BC, a thousand years later. And the Tower of Babel was built on the plains of Mesopotamia in the 24th century BC, almost a thousand years before. This is the worst imaginable mishmash of stories and characters picked from a time frame of two thousand years.

## Pharao threatened people with crucifixion {#egyptian-crucifixion}

Surah 7:123-124

> Pharaoh threatened, … "I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then crucify you all.”

Crucifixion was never used by ancient Egypt, and did not become a common form of execution by the Romans in the 6th century BC.

See also:

- Surah 20:71
- Surah 25:49

## The Israelites were misled by a Samaritan {#misled-by-samaritan}

Surah 20:85

> Allah responded, “We have indeed tested your people in your absence, and the Samaritan has led them astray.

The Samaritan people did not exist until at least a thousand years after the event where the Israelites were misled into worshipping the golden calf.

## Jesus was not crucified {#no-crucifixion}

Surah 4:157

> and their saying, “We have surely killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah. ”In fact, they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them as if they had. And indeed, those who differed over him are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it—just following assumptions. And certainly, they did not kill him.

That Jesus was crucified by order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate is subject to "almost universal assent" among scholars. Lightfoot Professor of Divinity James Dunn stated that the fact of the baptism and crucifixion of Jesus "rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts, they are obvious starting points for an attempt to clarify the what and why of Jesus' mission." Atheist scholar Bart Ehrman says "Nearly all critical scholars agree at least on those points about the historical Jesus."

In other words, the Quran is historically false.

## No one was named John before John the Baptist

Surah 19:7 

> “O Zachariah! Indeed, We give you the good news of a son, whose name will be John—a name We have not given to anyone before.”

John is not a unique name. in fact it was one of the most popular names in the first century. There are at least 5 people in the New testament named John. The Hebrew equivalent of the name John is "Johanan" and "Jehohanan", which means "Yahweh is gracious." There are at least 17 persons in the old testament with this name, for a total of 22 people in the whole Bible. So Allah and the Quran are wrong that John was the first one with this name.

# Health and hygiene

## Muslims aren’t allowed to urinate standing {#no-urinating-standing}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 308](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:308) 

> … 'Umar said: "The Messenger of Allah saw me urinating while standing, and he said: 'O 'Umar, do not urinate standing up.' So I never urinated whilst standing after that."

## Muslims aren’t allowed to urinate in water {#no-urinating-in-water}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 343](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:343) 

> …The Messenger of Allah forbade urinating into standing water.

So it seems our Muslim brothers can not urinate into a water toilet, especially not standing up.

Also: 

- [Sahih Muslim 281](https://sunnah.com/muslim:281)

## Dogs would urinate in the mosque and no one would clean it up

[Sahih al-Bukhari 174](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:174)

> And narrated Hamza bin 'Abdullah: My father said. "During the lifetime of Allah's Apostle, the dogs used to urinate, and pass through the mosques (come and go), nevertheless they never used to sprinkle water on it (urine of the dog.)"

# Jews

## The verse they use to lie that Islam is peaceful 

Surah 5:32

> That is why We ordained **for the Children of Israel** that whoever takes a life—**unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land**—it will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity. ˹Although˺ Our messengers already came to them with clear proofs, many of them still transgressed afterwards through the land.

This verse is often quoted by Muslims doing Taqqiya to say that Islam is peaceful. But as you can see, it is a command directed to the people of Israel, not Muslims. 

It is a quotation from the Talmud. So the Quran is actually saying that the commentary by a rabbi in the Talmud is "revelation from Allah."

Also notice that this command has the stipulation "unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land", meaning that Jews had the right of capital punishment for those spreading mischief in the land. But in other cases, killing one would be like killing all. 

And what "land" is it talking about? Well, the land of the Jews, Israel, or Palestine as it was later renamed. 

*So according to the Quran, the Jews has the right to execute capital punishment on those spreading mischief in the land of Israel.*

But wait, it gets better. The next verse is what applies to Muslims:

Surah 5:33

> Indeed, the penalty **for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger** and spread mischief in the land is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land.** This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous **punishment in the Hereafter.**

This is directed to Muslims, how to deal with those who "who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land". The Muslims are to kill, crucify, dismember and exile people. And after they die, Allah sends them to hell."

## Islam's Final Solution to the Jewish Question {#final-solution}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2926](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2926)

> …"The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."

# Jihad

See also [Violence](#violence) and [Muhammad and violence](#muhammad-and-violence).

## Jizya

[Sahih Muslim 1731a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1731a)

> …If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them.…

This is the future of your country if you invite Islam: They will sooner or later take over, and if you do not join their ideology, you will have to pay a tax to them. And if you refuse to pay them, they will kill you.

## Even stones will help jihadists to kill Jews 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2926](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2926)

> …"The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."

## Muslims can indiscriminately kill innocent civilians 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3012](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012)

> The Prophet … was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, "They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)." I also heard the Prophet saying, "[The institution of Hima (sanctuary)](#hima) is invalid except for Allah and His Apostle."

So his men, having a shred of humanity, asked about the possibility of killing non-combatant women and children. Muhammad said that it doesn't matter, they're all the same, so it's ok to kill innocent civilians. No mercy.

### "Hima"

In the context of warfare in Islamic teachings, the term "hima" is sometimes used to denote a protected zone or area during times of conflict. It signifies a space where civilians and their property are safeguarded from harm. The Prophet Muhammad emphasized the importance of protecting Muslim non-combatants, including women, children, and the elderly, and avoiding unnecessary destruction during warfare. As pointed out in [Sahih al-Bukhari 3012](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012), Hima is invalid for non-Muslims though. Muslims do not need to care about innocent bystanders but can just go on killing women and children indiscriminately.

## Fight until unbelievers convert

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6924, 6925](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6924)

> …[Muhammad] said: 'I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, ' and whoever said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah', Allah will save his property and his life from me…

# Mohammad

Things that Mohammad did.

## Muhammad was a pedophile

### Mohammed married 6 year old Aisha {#child-sexual-abuse}

[Sunna an Nasa'i 3378](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3378)

> "The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls."

[Sahih al Bukhari 6130](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130)

> Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger  used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was **a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.**) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)

Aisha, the favorite wife of Muhammad, was 6 years old when Muhammad married her, and he had sex with their when she was only 9 years old. She was prepubescent, still playing with dolls together with her playmates. Dolls are usually forbidden but we're allowed for Aisha since she was a "little girl" so young that normal Islamic rules didn't yet apply to her.

### Muhammed used to put his face into Aishas crotch and recite Quran verses when she was menstruating {#crotch-talk}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 634](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:634)

> …'Aishah said: "The Messenger of Allah used to put his head in my lap when I was menstruating and recite Qur'an."

### Muhammad used to fondle Aisha when she was menstruating {#fondling-aisha}

[Sahih al Bukhari 299](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:299)

> Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet  and I used to take a bath from a single pot while we were Junub. During the menses, he used to order me to put on an Izar (dress worn below the waist) and used to fondle me. …

### Muhammad used to suck and on Aishas tongue

> Narrated Aisha, [Mother of the believers]: The Prophet used to kiss her and suck her tongue when he was fasting.

### Muhammad French-kissed a little boy

[Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 1183](https://sunnah.com/adab:1183)

> …Then he said, 'Where is the little one? Call the little one to me.' Hasan came running and jumped into his lap. Then he put his hand in his beard. Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, opened his mouth and put his mouth in his mouth. Then he said, O Allah, I love him, so love him and the one who loves him!'"

### Muhammad was baffled that other men were not pedophiles like him

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5080](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5080)

> Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: When I got married, Allah's Messenger said to me, "What type of lady have you married?" I replied, "I have married a matron' He said, "Why, don't you have a liking for the virgins and for fondling them?" Jabir also said: Allah's Messenger said, "Why didn't you marry a young girl so that you might play with her and she with you?'

### Muhammad believed silence meant consent

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5137](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5137)

> Narrated Aisha: I said, "O Allah's Messenger! A virgin feels shy." He said, "Her consent is (expressed by) her silence."

A true rape culture.

See also [Rape](#rape).

## Muhammad and family

### Muhammad would not provide more than one garment each to his wives {#miserly-husband}

[Sahih al Bukhari 312](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:312)

> Narrated 'Aisha: None of us had more than a single garment and we used to have our menses while wearing it. Whenever it got soiled with blood of menses we used to apply saliva to the blood spot and rub off the blood with our nails.

When they had menstrual blood stain their garments they would have to clean them with spit.

### A wife of Muhammad used a dish to catch yellow menstrual discharge while praying {#discharge-dish}

[Sahih al Bukhari 310](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:310)

> Narrated 'Aisha: "One of the wives of Allah's Messenger  joined him in I'tikaf and she noticed blood and yellowish discharge (from her private parts) and put a dish under her when she prayed."

### Muhammad daughter Fatima was denied an inheritance {#daughter-no-inheritance}

Instead they had to go to Abu Bakr to get what they needed to survive as a charity.

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 2969](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2969)

> Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin: Fatimah was demanding (the property of) sadaqah of the Messenger of Allah  at Medina and Fadak, and what remained from the fifth of Khaybar. Aisha quoted AbuBakr as saying: The Messenger of Allah  said: We are not inherited; whatever we leave is sadaqah (charity). The family of Muhammad will eat from this property, that is, from the property of Allah. They will not take more then their sustenance.

### The wives of Muhammad were also denied an inheritance. {#wives-no-inheritance}

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 2976](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2976)

> Narrated 'Aishah: When the Messenger of Allah  died, the wives of the Prophet  intended to send 'Uthman b. 'Affan to Abu Bakr to ask him their cost of living from (the inheritance of) the Prophet . Thereupon 'Aishah said: Did not the Messenger of Allah  say: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah (charity).

### Muhammad died a pauper

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3596](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3596)

> "I heard 'Amr bin Al-Harith say: 'I saw the Messenger of Allah and he left nothing behind except his white mule, his weapon and some land which he left as a charity.'"

### The parents of Muhammad are in hell {#parents-in-hell}

[Sahih Muslim 976b](https://sunnah.com/muslim/11/135)

> Abu Huraira reported: The Apostle of Allah  visited the grave of his mother and he wept, and moved others around him to tears, and said: **I sought permission from my Lord to beg forgiveness for her but it was not granted to me**, and I sought permission to visit her grave and it was granted to me so visit the graves, for that makes you mindful of death.

Muhammad was not allowed to ask forgiveness for his mother, meaning Allah will not forgive her, meaning she is in hell.

[Sunan Abu Dawud 4718](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4718)

> Anas said : A man asked : where is my father, Messenger of Allah? He replied! Your father is in Hell. When he turned his back, he said : **My father and your father are in Hell.**

Muhammad's father is in hell.

## Muhammad and slavery

See also [Slavery](#slavery)

### Muhammad owned slaves

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5433](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5433)

> Allah's Messenger went to his slave tailor...

[Muwatta Malik book 21 hadith 25](https://sunnah.com/urn/509860)

> Rifaa ibn Zayd presented a black slave boy to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, whose name was Midam...Midam was unsaddling the camel of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when a stray arrow struck and killed him. The people said, 'Good luck to him! The Garden!' The Messenger of Allah said, 'No! By He in whose hand my self is! The cloak which he took from the spoils on the Day of Khaybar before they were distributed will blaze with fire on him.'

Muhammad had a black slave who was killed in battle, and Muhammad said he went to hell.

### Muhammad sold slaves

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2534](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2534)

> Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: A man amongst us declared that his slave would be freed after his death. The Prophet called for that slave and sold him. The slave died the same year.

## Muhammad and water

### Muhammad told his followers to drink sewer water {#sewer-water}

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 67](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:67)

> Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri: I heard that the people asked the Prophet of Allah : Water is brought for you from the well of Buda'ah. It is a well in which dead dogs, menstrual clothes and excrement of people are thrown. The Messenger of Allah  replied: Verily water is pure and is not defiled by anything...

[Sunnan Ibn Majah 520](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:520)

> "We came to a pond in which there was the carcass of a donkey, so we refrained from using the water until the Messenger of Allah came to us and said: 'Water is not made impure by anything.' Then we drank from it and gave it to our animals to drink, and we carried some with us."

To say that water is not defiled by anything, not even the rotting corpses of dogs and donkeys, menstrual waste products and literal feces is insane and unscientific. This unhygienic idea has probably cost the lives of untold numbers of people throughout history.

### Muhammad gargled with dick water {#dick-water}

[Sahih al Bukhari 274](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:274)

> Water was placed for the ablution of Allah's Messenger after Janaba. He poured water with his right hand over his left twice or thrice and then washed his private parts and rubbed his hand on the earth or on a wall twice or thrice and then rinsed his mouth, washed his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out...

Notice that after washing his private parts he uses the same water to rinse his mouth and nose.

[Mishkat al-Masabih 1532](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:1532)

> She said that when the Prophet had a complaint he would blow on himself, ejecting saliva, reciting the Mu'awwidhah, and wipe himself with his hand.

### Muhammad spat in the mouth of a newborn child {#spitting-in-mouth-of-child}

[Sahih al Bukhari 5469](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5469)

> I conceived 'Abdullah bin AzZubair at Mecca and went out (of Mecca) while I was about to give birth. I came to Medina and encamped at Quba', and gave birth at Quba'. Then I brought the child to Allah's Messenger  and placed it (on his lap). He asked for a date, chewed it, and put his saliva in the mouth of the child. So the first thing to enter its stomach was the saliva of Allah's Messenger

### Muhammad urinated squatting

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 29](https://sunnah.com/nasai:29)

> Whoever tells you that the Messenger of Allah urinated standing up, do not believe him, for he would not urinate except while squatting."

### Muhammad urinated standing

[Sahih al Bukhari 2471](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2471)

> Narrated Hudhaifa: I saw Allah's Messenger coming to the dumps of some people and urinated there while standing.

It seems that Hudhaifa [contradicts Aisha](#muhammad-urinated-squatting) and that [Muhammad didn't practice what he taught](#no-urinating-standing)

### Muhammad urinated in some weird way

[Sunan Ibn Majah 341](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:341)

> It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said: "The Messenger of Allah turned towards a mountain pass and urinated, until I took pity on him because of the way he parted his legs when he urinated."

### Muhammad prohibited urinating in holes {#urinating-in-holes}

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 29](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:29)

> The Prophet prohibited to urinate in a hole.
> Qatadah (a narrator) was asked about the reason for the disapproval of urinating in a hole. He replied: It is said that these (holes) are the habitats of the jinn.

### Muhammad prescribed the drinking of camel urine {#drinking-camel-urine}

[Mishkat al-Masabih 3539](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:3539)

> Anas told that some people of ‘Ukl who had come to the Prophet and accepted Islam found Medina unhealthy, so he ordered them to go to the camels of the sadaqa and drink some of their urine...

[He later tortured these people to death.](#tortured-to-death)

### Muhammad prohibited urinating towards the qibla {#urinating-toward-qibla}

[Sunnan Ibn Majah 325](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:325)

> "The Messenger of Allah forbade facing the Qiblah when urinating. But I saw him, one year before he died, facing the Qiblah (while urinating)."

Hypocrite.

## Muhammad and other bodily fluids

### Muhammad wore semen encrusted clothes {#semen-clothes}

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 372](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:372)

> I used to rub off the semen from the clothes of the Messenger of Allah. He would would pray in it.

> Incase I (Aisha) found that (semen) on the garment of the Messenger of Allah dried up, I scraped it off with my nails.

I can imagine this poor girl walking after this old man, rubbing dried up semen stains out of his clothes with her finger nail while he's on his way to the mosque.

## Muhammad's appearance

### Muhammad was white 

[Sunan Abu Dawud 4864](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4864)

> Sa’id al-Jariri quoted Abu al-Tufail as saying: I saw the Messenger of Allah. I asked: How did you see him? He said: He was white, good-looking, and when he walked, it looked as if he was descending to a low ground.

[Ash-Shama'il Al-Muhammadiyah 12](https://sunnah.com/shamail:12)

> Abu Huraira … said:
> "Allah’s Messenger … was white, as if he were fashioned from silver, with loosely curled hair."

> The Messenger of Allah was not very tall nor was he [very] short, nor was he pale white, nor was he brown, nor was the wave of his hair completely curly nor straight…

## Muhammad and violence

See also [Jihad](#jihad), and [Violence](#violence)

### Muhammad tortured people to death {#tortured-to-death}

[Mishkat al-Masabih 3539](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:3539)

> … So he sent people in pursuit of them, and when they were brought he had their hands and feet cut off and their eyes put out and left them to die without cauterising them to stop the flow of blood. A version says nails were driven into their eyes. Another says he ordered nails to be heated and after having them blinded with them he had them thrown out on the harra, and although they begged for water they were left to die without being given any.

These people had stolen some camels so Muhammad **had their hands and feet cut off and their eyes put out** with white hot nails, and then left them to die from thirst and bleeding out.

### Muhammad cut of the hand of a woman 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6800](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6800)

> Narrated Aisha: The Prophet cut off the hand of a lady, and that lady used to come to me, and I used to convey her message to the Prophet and she repented, and her repentance was sincere.

### Muhammad personally stoned a woman

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2555](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2555)

> a woman came to the Prophet and confessed to committing fornication. He issued orders, and her garments were tightened around her (so that her private parts would not become uncovered) then he stoned her, then he offered the funeral prayer for her.

In contrast Jesus defended a woman against being stoned for adultery. (John 8:1-11)

### Muhammad was a terrorist

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2977](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2977)

> ...I have been made victorious with terror cast in the hearts of the enemy...

### Muhammad had children with pubic hairs killed

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 4981](https://sunnah.com/nasai:4981)

> It was narrated that 'Atiyyah said: 'I was among the prisoners of Quraizah; we were examined, and whoever had grown (pubic) hair was killed, and whoever had not grown hair, he was allowed to live and was not killed."

## Muhammad's mental and spiritual health

### Muhammad was bewitched

[Sahih Al Bukhari 3268](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3268)

> Magic was worked on the Prophet so that he began to fancy that he was doing a thing which he was not actually doing. One day he invoked (Allah) for a long period and then said, "I feel that Allah has inspired me as how to cure myself. Two persons came to me (in my dream) and sat, one by my head and the other by my feet. One of them asked the other, "What is the ailment of this man?" The other replied, 'He has been bewitched"...

[Sahih Al Bukhari 5765 provides more detail:](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5765)

> Magic was worked on Allah's Messenger  so that he used to think that he had sexual relations with his wives while he actually had not...

### Muhammad was suicidal

[Sahih al Bukhari 91](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/91)

> …the Prophet  became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear before him and say, "O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah's Messenger  in truth" whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he had said before.

### Muhammad was paranoid, accusing a child of being a supervillain {#dajjal}

The Dajjal is an evil figure in Islamic eschatology who will pretend to be the promised Messiah and later claim to be God, appearing before the Day of Judgment according to the Islamic eschatological narrative. Muhammad harassed, stalked, and spread rumors about a young boy, saying he was this Dajjal, making him depressed and suicidal.

[Sahih Muslim 2930 a, 2931, 169 d](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2930a)

> [Muhammad went] to Ibn Sayyad … he found him playing with children … Allah's Messenger struck his back with his hands. Allah's Messenger said: Ibn Sayyad, don't you bear witness that I am the messenger of Allah? Ibn Sayyad looked toward him and he said: I bear witness to the fact that you [are] the messenger of the unlettered. … 'Umar b. Khattab said: Allah's Messenger, permit me that I should [behead him]. Thereupon Allah's Messenger said: If he is the same (Dajjal) who would appear near the Last Hour, you would not be able to overpower him, and if he is not that there is no good for you to kill him. 

There was some back and forth banter. But since this boy didn't play along with Muhammad's delusions, Muhammad insinuated that he is the Dajjal.

> after some time Allah's Messenger … went towards the palm trees where Ibn Sayyad was. When [he] went near the tree he hid himself behind a tree with the intention of hearing something from Ibn sayyad before Ibn Sayyad could see him, but Allah's Messenger saw him on a bed with a blanket around him … and Ibn Sayyad's mother saw Allah's Messenger behind the trunk of the palm tree. She said … here is Muhammad. Thereupon Ibn Sayyad jumped up …

So Muhammed is actually stalking a sleeping young boy, trying to eavesdrop to confirm his suspicion that this boy is a supervillain.

> then [Muhammad] made a mention of the Dajjal and said: …(the Dajjal) is one-eyed and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is not one-eyed.…

It would appear that perhaps Ibn Saiyad was one-eyed, because suddenly Muhammad starts spreading a rumour that the Dajjal is one-eyes, and for the rest of his life, Ibn Saiyad had to live with this rumour. Because of this, the boy grew up to be depressed and suicidal.

[Sahih Muslim 2927c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2927c)

> …lbn Saiyad was along with us. … I felt terribly frightend from him as it was said about him that he was the Dajjal. He brought his goods and placed them by my luggage and I said: It is intense heat. Would you not place that under that tree? And he did that. Then there appeared before us a flock of sheep. He went and brought a cup of milk and said: Abu Said, drink that. I said it is intense heat and the milk is also hot (whereas the fact was) that I did not like to drink from his hands or to take it from his hand and he said: Abu Said, I think that I should take a rope and suspend it by the tree and then commit suicide because of the talks of the people…

Abu Said, like most people, were afraid of Ibn Saiyad because of the rumor started by Muhammad, so he tried to avoid him. Ibn Saiyad, having been ostracized like that his whole life said that it made him want to hang himself.

## Muhammad's incompetence

### Muhammad almost caused a famine {#caused-famine}

> It was narrated from 'Aisha that the Prophet heard some sounds and said: “What is this noise?” They said: “Palm trees that are being pollinated.” He said: “If they did not do that it would be better.” So they did not pollinate them that year, and the dates did not mature properly. they mentioned that to the Prophet and he said: “If it is one of the matters of your religion, then refer to me.”

Muhammad's incompetence caused the harvest to almost fail, yet he had the gall to tell people to consult him.

## Muhammad and miracles 

### Muhammad did NOT perform miracles {#no-miracles}

Surah 6:109

> And they swore by Allah their most solemn oaths that if a sign were to come to them, they would believe in it. Say, “Signs are only with Allah,” but how do you know that even if it did come, they would still not believe?

Surah 17:59

> And nothing prevented Us from sending miraculous signs except that the ancients disbelieved in them. ….


People didn't believe Muhammad was a prophet because true prophets of God were accompanied by signs and miracles. They asked for a sign, any signs, and swore that if they got it they would believe, but Allah/Muhammad gives the excuse that they would not believe anyway.

Also:

- Surah 6:37
- Surah 13:7
- Surah 20:20

### Muhammad DID perform miracles {#did-miracles}

[Sahih al Bukhari 3637](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3637)

> …The Meccan people requested Allah's Messenger to show them a miracle, and so he showed them the splitting of the moon.

So which is it? Muhammad never did any miracles, or Muhammad did miracles? This is a [contradiction](#contradictions).

## Other things about Muhammad 

### Muhammad cursed an orphan girl to die young {#cursed-orphan}

[Sahih Muslim 2603](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2603)

> Anas b. Malik reported that there was an orphan girl with Umm Sulaim (who was the mother of Anas). Allah's Messenger saw that orphan girl and said: O, it is you; you have grown young. May you not advance in years! That slave-girl returned to Umm Sulaim weeping. Umm Sulaim said: O daughter, what is the matter with you? She said: Allah's Apostle has invoked curse upon me that I should not grow in age and thus I would never grow in age…

The Bible says that being kind and help orphans in their need is pure and undefiled worship. (James 1:27) 

Even Surah 93:9 says "so as for the orphan, do not oppress them". But Muhammad curses this orphan girl to die young. A young girl, with no mother or father, who is a slave, this girl already has a tough life and Muhammad decides to break her heart and psychologically traumatize her. When asked why, he smiles and says it doesn't matter because she'll go to paradise when she dies anyway. Sick and twisted.

## Muhammad didn't like garlic {#garlic}

[Sahih al Bukhari 5451](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5451)

> Narrated `Abdul `Aziz: It was said to Anas "What did you hear the Prophet  saying about garlic?" Anas replied, "Whoever has eaten (garlic) should not approach our mosque."

## Muhammad was the first Muslim {#first-muslim}

Surah 6:14

> Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Will I take any guardian other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who provides for all and is not in need of provision?” Say, “**I have been commanded to be the first to submit** and not be one of the polytheists.”

## Allah considered Muhammad the perfect example {#perfect-example}

Surah 33:21

> Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for whoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah often.

[Quran 68:4](https://quran.com/68/4)

> And you are truly a man of outstanding character.

## Muhammad copied a lot from Christians {#copycat}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5917](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5917)

> The Prophet used to copy the people of the Scriptures in matters in which there was no order from Allah.

## The death of Muhammad

### How did Muhammad die?

#### Allah promises to cut off his aorta if he tells a lie {#cutting-aorta}

[Quran 69:44-47](https://quran.com/69/44-47)

> Had the Messenger made up something in Our Name, We would have certainly seized him by his right hand, then severed his aorta, and none of you could have shielded him ˹from Us˺!

[Musnad Ahmad 107](https://sunnah.com/ahmad:107)

> And if he (Muhammad ﷺ) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah). We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), And then **We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta)**, And none of you could have withheld Us from (punishing) him...”

So Allah promises that Muhammed ever acts as a false prophet, Allah will cut off his aorta.

#### Muhammad eats a poisoned lamb {#poisoned-lamb}

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 4512](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4512)

> Narrated Abu Hurairah: ...So a Jewess presented him at Khaybar with a roasted sheep which she had poisoned. The Messenger of Allah  ate of it and the people also ate. He then said: Take away your hands (from the food), for it has informed me that it is poisoned. Bishr ibn al-Bara' ibn Ma'rur al-Ansari died. So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess (and said to her): What motivated you to do the work you have done? She said: If you were a prophet, it would not harm you; but if you were a king, I should rid the people of you. The Messenger of Allah  then ordered regarding her and she was killed. He then said about the pain of which he died: I continued to feel pain from the morsel which I had eaten at Khaybar. This is the time when **it has cut off my aorta.** 

See also:

- [Sahih al Bukhari 2617](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2617)

- [Sunnah Abu Dawud 4508](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4508)
- [Sunnah Abu Dawud 4510](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4510)

After Muhammad kills the whole male Jewish population of Khaibar, a Jewish woman offers him roasted lamb. Being arguably the dumbest person in history, Muhammad accepts it. And it turns out that it was poisoned. Some of his men died, but Muhammad was affected for a long time from the lingering poison. Notice that Muhammad is saying that the pain from the poison feels like it is cutting off his aorta.

#### Muhammad dies from having his aorta cut {#muhammad-dies}

[Sahih al Bukhari 4428](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4428)
  
> Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet  in his ailment in which he died, used to say, "O `Aisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, **I feel as if my aorta is being cut** from that poison."

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 4513](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4513)

> ...I do not think about the illness of my son except the poisoned sheep of which he had eaten with you at Khaybar. The Prophet  said: And I do not think about my illness except that. **This is the time when it cut off my aorta**...

Muhammad eventually died from the poisoned lamb of a jewish woman, and he did so while complaining that he felt as if his aorta was being cut. This is exactly how Allah said he would die if he was a false prophet.

Notice also the poetic biblical references in that a false anti-christ prophet was killed by Allah after eating of the Lamb that came from a Jewish woman.

### What was the last orders of Muhammad to his followers? {#last-orders}

> Ibn 'Abbas said... The Prophet on his death-bed, gave three orders saying, "Expel the pagans from the Arabian Peninsula, respect and give gifts to the foreign delegates as you have seen me dealing with them." I forgot the third (order)"...

What's that, Ibn Abbas? The last order of Muhammad wasn't noteworthy enough to even commit to memory? But at least you remembered the genocide part.

### What was the last words of Muhammad? {#last-words}

While Jesus used his last moments to forgive his enemies, Muhammad used his last moments to curse one third of the world population.

[Sahih Muslim 531](https://sunnah.com/muslim:531)

>  'A'isha and Abdullah reported: As the Messenger of Allah  was about to breathe his last, he drew his sheet upon his face and when he felt uneasy, he uncovered his face and said in that very state: Let there be curse upon the Jews and the Christians that they have taken the graves of their apostles as places of worship. He in fact warned (his men) against what they (the Jews and the Christians) did.

### What was the last action of Muhammad? {#last-actions}

Sharing a toothbrush with two other people.

[Sahih al Bukhari 4450](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4450)

> Aisha added, "The Prophet  expired on the day of my turn in my house and he was taken unto Allah while his head was against my chest and his saliva mixed with my saliva." 'Aisha added, "Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr came in, carrying a Siwak he was cleaning his teeth with. Allah's Messenger  looked at it and I said to him, 'O 'AbdurRahman! Give me this Siwak.' So he gave it to me and I cut it, chewed it (it's end) and gave it to Allah's Messenger  who cleaned his teeth with it while he was resting against my chest."

# Paradise

The Islamic paradise is a very physical place where people will eat fruit that all tastes the same. Then they will not poop, but belch out the excrement as musk.

## All fruit looks the same in paradise {#boring-fruit}

[Quran 2:25](https://quran.com/2/25)

> And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens under which rivers flow. Every time they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” for they will be given fruit that resemble one another. They will have purified spouses, and they will abide therein forever.

## Paradise dwellers don't poop but belch and sweat musk {#belching-musk}

> I heard Allah's Apostle as saying that the inmates of Paradise would eat and drink but would neither spit, nor pass water, nor void excrement, nor suffer catarrah. It was said: Then, what would happen with food? Thereupon he said: They would belch and sweat (and it would be over with their food), and their sweat would be that of musk and they would glorify and praise Allah as easily as you breathe.

> ...their wives will be large-eyed maidens...

## Paradise dwellers will be 38.4 meters tall {#tall-people}

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their form would be alike as one single person after the form of their father (Adam) sixty cubits tall.

60 Arabic cubits á 64cm each equals 38.4 meters.

## There are 7 heavens {#seven-heavens}

Surah 2:29

> It is He Who created for you all that is in the earth, then He turned towards the heaven and made them seven heavens...

# Prayer

## Looking up while praying makes you go blind {#praying-looking-up-blind}

[Sahih al Bukhari 750](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:750)

> The Prophet said, "What is wrong with those people who look towards the sky during the prayer?" His talk grew stern while delivering this speech and he said, "They should stop (looking towards the sky during the prayer); otherwise their eyesight would be taken away."

## Looking up while praying turns your head into a donkey head {#praying-looking-up-donkey}

[Sahih al Bukhari 691](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:691)

> The Prophet said, "Isn't he who raises his head before the Imam afraid that Allah may transform his head into that of a donkey or his figure into that of a donkey?"

# The Quran {#quran}

## The Quran confirms the Bible {#confirms-bible}

Surah 2: 88-91

> And when there comes to them a Book from Allah, **confirming what is with them**… When it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah Hath sent down, "they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us:" yet they reject all besides, even if it be Truth **confirming what is with them**…

The Quran confirms the Bible that was available in the 7th century as being uncorrupted and coming from Allah. [We have extant copies that are even 300](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Sinaiticus)-[900 years older than the Quran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls), and they are identical to our modern Bibles. This disproves the idea some Muslims put forth that the Bible has been corrupted.

## How to know if the Quran is inspired {#proof-of-inspiration}

Surah 2:23-24

> 23 If you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down upon Our slave, then produce a chapter like it and call upon your helpers other than Allah, if you are truthful.24 But if you did not do it, and you can never do it; then beware of the Fire whose fuel will be people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers.

The only claim to inspiration the Quran makes is in its literary excellence, claiming no one can produce a chapter like it. But if you have read it the first thing that strikes you is that literary speaking, it is garbage. Even a mediocre poet would be able to write a chapter far more excellent than most chapters of the Quran.

## The Quran is not perfectly preserved {#not-preserved}

One miraculous claim made is that the Quran has been perfectly preserved. However the Quran and Hadiths contradict this.

### Allah foretold that the Quran wouldn’t be perfectly preserved {#no-preservation}

Surah 2:106

> If We ever abrogate a verse or **cause it to be forgotten**, We replace it with a better or similar one. Do you not know that Allah is Most Capable of everything?

### Two chapters of the Quran were forgotten {#surahs-forgotten}

[Sahih Muslim 1050](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1050)

> Abu Harb b. Abu al-Aswad… We used to recite a surah which resembled in length and severity to (Surah) Bara'at. **I have, however, forgotten it** with the exception of this which I remember out of it:" If there were two valleys full of riches, for the son of Adam, he would long for a third valley, and nothing would fill the stomach of the son of Adam but dust." And we used so recite a surah which resembled one of the surahs of Musabbihat, and **I have forgotten it**, but remember (this much) out of it:" Oh people who believe, why do you say that which you do not practise" and" that is recorded in your necks as a witness (against you) and you would be asked about it on the Day of Resurrection"

This reciter admits that they **used to recite** two surahs meaning it was once part of the Quran, but that they just forgot them. He remembers some fragments, but these match nothin in the Quran, proving that these surahs are gone forever. This proves the Quran has not been perfectly preserved.

### Two chapters of the Quran were eaten by a sheep {#sheep-ate-surahs}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 1944](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1944)

> It was narrated that 'Aishah said “The Verse of stoning and of breastfeeding an adult ten times was revealed, and the paper was with me under my pillow. When the Messenger of Allah died, we were preoccupied with his death, and a tame sheep came in and ate it.”

How can the Quran be perfectly preserved when two Surah's were literally eaten by a sheep?

## Chapters of the Quran could be ordered on demand {#surah-on-demand}

[Sahih al Bukhari 4483](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4483)

> I also said, 'O Allah's Messenger ! Good and bad persons visit you! Would that you ordered the Mothers of the believers to cover themselves with veils.' So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were revealed. 

Apparently, chapters could be requested on demand by the followers of Muhammad to suit their personal preferences. How convenient.

## Denying a Quran verse is a capital offense {#denying-quran}

> It was narrated from Ibn'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah said:
> “Whoever denies a Verse of the Qur'an, it is permissible to strike his neck (i.e., execute him)

## A Christian wrote the Quran

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3617](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3617)

> There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read Surat-al-Baqara and Al-Imran, and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: "Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him."

At least part of the Quran was written down by or edited by a Christian convert to Islam (and later re-convert to Christianity). He claimed to understand it better than Muhammad.

# Racism

## Muhammad traded black slaves {#black-slaves}

[Sahih Muslim 1602](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1602)

> Jabir … reported: There came a slave and pledged allegiance to Allah's Apostle on migration; [who] did not know that he was a slave. Then there came his master and demanded him back, whereupon Allah's Apostle said: Sell him to me. And he bought him for two black slaves…

It seems the exchange rate is two black slaves for one Muslim slave.

This is from chapter 23 which heading  reads:

> Chapter 23: The permissibility of **selling animals for animals of the same kind and of different quality**

## Black people are created for hell {#blacks-made-for-hell}

> …“God created Adam when He created him and struck his right shoulder and brought forth his offspring white like small ants. And he struck his left shoulder and brought forth his offspring black as though they were charcoal. Then He said to the party on his right side, ‘To paradise, and I do not care’ and He said to the party in his left shoulder, ‘To hell, and I do not care’.”

According to Muhammed, white people are destined for heaven and black people are destined for hell.

## Turks look like their faces were hit with a hammer {#turks}

[Sahih Muslim 2912 d](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2912d)

> The Last Hour would not come until the Muslims fight with the Turks-a people whose faces would be like hammered shields wearing clothes of hair and walking (with shoes) of hair.

Another description of Turks:

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2928](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2928)

> …The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Turks; people with small eyes, red faces, and flat noses. Their faces will look like shields coated with leather…

## Ethiopians have heads like raisins {#raisin-heads}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 693](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:693)

> "Listen and obey (your chief) even if an Ethiopian whose head is like a raisin were made your chief."

## Muhammad didn't like black dogs {#black-dogs}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3205](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3205)

> Were it not that dogs form one of the communities, I would have commanded that they be killed. But kill those that are all black...

## Black people symbolize disease {#black-disease}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 7039](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7039)

> …I saw in a dream a black woman with unkempt hair going out of Medina and settling at Mahai'a. I interpreted that as a symbol of the epidemic of Medina being transferred to Mahai'a…

When Muhammad sees a black woman in a dream he automatically assumes she represents an epidemic.

## On judgement day, people will turn white or black {#blackface-hell}

Surah 3:106-107

> on a day when some faces are whitened and some faces are blackened. So as for those whose faces were blackened: “Did you deny after having attained faith?” Then taste the punishment on account of what you used to deny. And as for those whose faces were whitened—(they are) in Allah’s mercy; therein they abide.

# Rape

## It is ok to rape captured women {#raping-captives}

[Sunan Abi Dawud 2155](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2155)

> Abu Sa’id Al Khudri said “The Apostle of Allaah sent a military expedition to Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain. They met their enemy and fought with them. They defeated them and took them captives. Some of the Companions of Apostle of Allah were reluctant to have relations with the female captives because of their pagan husbands. So, Allaah the exalted sent down the Qur’anic verse “And all married women are forbidden unto you save those captives whom your right hand posses.” This is to say that they are lawful for them when they complete their waiting period.

**Those captives whom your right hand posses** means captives taken in war. The Muslims at this battle, horny perverts though they were, at least had the basic human decency of not raping women in front of their husbands. So this verse that Muhammad conveniently came up with makes it permissible for Muslim men to rape women that they take captive.

[Quran 4:24](https://quran.com/4/24)

> Also ˹forbidden are˺ married women—except ˹female˺ captives in your possession...

## Muslims don't have to worry about getting their rape victims pregnant

[Sahih Muslim 1438a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1438a)

> We went out with Allah's Messenger on the expedition to the Bi'l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing [interrupted coitus]. But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah's Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah's Messenger, and he said: It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born.

Not only are Muslims allowed to rape women, but can just discard them like trash and not bother about them becoming pregnant.

# Salvation 

How Muslims are saved on judgment day is confusing and contradictory.

## No ransom 

Surah 2:48

> Guard yourselves against a Day when no soul will stand in place of another, no intercession will be accepted for it, nor any ransom; nor will they be helped.

So there will be no ransom for anyone. This contradicts [other sources saying that Muslims can be ransomed](#ransomed-from-hell). 


## Ransomed from hell by Jews and Christians {#ransomed-from-hell}

[Sahih Muslim 2767 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2767a)

> Abu Musa' reported that Allah's Messenger said:
> When it will be the Day of Resurrection Allah would deliver to every Muslim a Jew or a Christian and say: That is your rescue from Hell-Fire.

Christianity teaches that Jesus is the perfect one who does not deserve hellfire but took this punishment in stead of those who have faith in him. Some Muslims think this is unjust saying that it's wrong that someone should take the punishment for someone else's sin. However here, Allah will let Jews and Christians take the punishment for the sins of Muslims. Is that just, though?

Als this implies that Jews and Christians as not sinners deserving of hell, but that Muslims are sinners deserving of hell. Otherwise, if the Jews and Christians were already in hell, the exchange could not be made.

## The Quran will come and intercede

[Sahih Muslim 804 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:804a)

> Recite the Qur'an, for on the Day of Resurrection it will come as an intercessor for those who recite It. Recite the two bright ones, al-Baqara and Surah Al 'Imran, for on the Day of Resurrection they will come as two clouds or two shades, or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them.

Islam teaches that the Quran is actually alive and will function as an intercessor on the day of judgment. It will come as clouds, shades, or flocks of birds, and it will speak, pleading for Muslims.

# Satan

## Satan urinates in your ear

[Sahih al Bukhari 1144](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1144)

> Narrated 'Abdullah: A person was mentioned before the Prophet and he was told that he had kept on sleeping till morning and had not got up for the prayer. The Prophet said, "Satan urinated in his ears."

## Satan farts to not hear the call to prayer {#satan-farts}

[Sahih Muslim 389a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:389a)

> When Satan hears the call to prayer, he turns back and breaks the wind so as not to hear the call being made...

## Yawning is from Satan

[Sahih al Bukhari 3289](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3289)

> Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, "Yawning is from Satan and if anyone of you yawns, he should check his yawning as much as possible, for if anyone of you (during the act of yawning) should say: 'Ha', Satan will laugh at him."

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2746](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2746)

> Allah loves the sneeze and He dislikes the Yawn, so when a man says Ah, Ah when yawning, indeed Ash-Shaitan laughs from inside his opening.

## Satan likes bells

[Sahih Muslim 2114](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2114)

> The bell is the musical instrument of the Satan.

Funny since in [Sahih al Bukhari 2](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2)  Muhammad says that his revelations were often like the ringing of a bell, so you don't have to wonder about it's true source.

> Al-Harith bin Hisham asked Allah's Messenger "O Allah's Messenger! How is the Divine Inspiration revealed to you?" Allah's Messenger replied, "Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of all and then this state passes off after I have grasped what is inspired.

> When you hear the braying of a donkey, then seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, for, verily, it has seen a Shaitan.

## Muhammad had a Satan

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3960](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3960)

> I said: "Don't you have a Shaitan?" He said: "Yes, but Allah helped me with him, so he submitted."


## Muhammad once defeated Satan in a wrestling match

[Sahih al Bukhari 1210](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1210)

> Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, "Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. Then I remembered the statement of Prophet Solomon, 'My Lord ! Bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.' Then Allah made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated)."

# Science

## Sperm comes from between the backbone and the ribs

Surah 86:6-7

> ˹They were˺ created from a spurting fluid, stemming from between the backbone and the ribcage.

## The sun sets in a muddy spring 

[Quran 18:86](https://quran.com/18/86?translations=17)

> Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a muddy spring, and he found a people at it. We said, "O Thulqarnayn, either you will torment them or you will take to yourself towards them a fair way."

## The earth is flat

[Quran 18:86](https://quran.com/71/19?translations=207)

> Allah has laid the earth out as a carpet for you,

## What determines if a child looks like its mother or father?

[Sahih al Bukhari 3329](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3329)

> If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife and gets discharge first, the child will resemble the father, and if the woman gets discharge first, the child will resemble her.

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 200](https://sunnah.com/nasai:200)

> 'The man's water is thick and white, and the woman's water is thin and yellow. Whichever of them comes first, the child will resemble (that parent).'"

## The urine of boys and girls are different

[Sunnan Ibn Majah 525](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:525)

> …He said, "This is because the urine of the boy is of water and clay, but the urine of the girl is of flesh and blood."…

## Non-Muslims eats in seven intestines, Muslims in one {#seven-intestines}

Apparently belief or disbelief in Islam changes the number of intestines you have.

[Sahih Muslim 2060 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2060a)

> …a non-Muslim eats in seven intestines whereas a Muslim eats in one intestine.

I'm pretty sure it does, eventually.

# Sex slaves

See also [Rape](#rape), [Women](#women)

## Muslims men can have sex slaves

Surah 4:3 

> If you fear you might fail to give orphan women their ˹due˺ rights ˹if you were to marry them˺, then marry other women of your choice—two, three, or four. But if you are afraid you will fail to maintain justice, then ˹content yourselves with˺ one or those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession.

A muslim man can marry up to four women, but if he thinks he can not give them their legal rights, he can just "content himself" one wife, **or** those "bondswomen" in his posession. the footnote on quran.com says "A bondwoman is a female slave that a man owned either through purchase or taking her captive in war."

Surah 33:50

> O Prophet! We have made lawful for you your wives to whom you have paid their ˹full˺ dowries as well as those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession, whom Allah has granted you... We have ordained for the believers in relation to their wives and those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession.

"Made lawful" means that he can have sex with them.

Surah 23:5-6; 70:29-30

> [Sucessful are the believers...] those who guard their chastity except with their wives or those [bondswomen] in their possession, for then they are free from blame

This passage says that a muslim should be chaste except with their wives (plural) or "those their right hand posesses", which would be women they have taken captive in war or bought as slaves. It's allowed for muslim men to have slaves that they have sex with and these slave women can not refuse them.

Surah 4:24

> Also ˹forbidden are˺ married women—except ˹female˺ captives in your possession.

They're not allowed to have sex with married women **except** if these **married women** have been captured in battle. Then it is allowed to have sex with these **married women**.

# Sin

## Allah predetermines adultery

[Sahih Muslim 2657 b](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2657b)

> Verily Allah has fixed the very portion of adultery which a man will indulge in, and which he of necessity must commit.

A man who commits adultery is really only doing the will of Allah, and has no choice in it.

# Slavery

See also [Muhammad and slavery](#muhammad-and-slavery)

## Runaway slaves lack protection

[Mishkat al-Masabih 3350](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:3350)

> If any slave runs away protection does not apply to him.

Compare to the Mosaic law in Deuteronomy 23:15-16:

> “You shall not give up to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you. He shall dwell with you, in your midst, in the place that he shall choose within one of your towns, wherever it suits him. You shall not wrong him.

## Gifting slaves is better than freeing them

[Sahih Muslim 999](https://sunnah.com/muslim:999)

> Maimuna bint Harith reported that she set free a slave-girl during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah and she made a mention of that to the Messenger of Allah and he said: Had you given her to your maternal uncles, you would have a greater reward.

## Black slaves are worth half of Arab slaves {#black-slaves-worth-less}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 4621](https://sunnah.com/nasai:4621Sunan an-Nasa'i 4621

> "A slave came and gave his pledge to the Messenger of Allah to emigrate, and the Prophet did not realize that he was a slave. Then his master came looking for him. The Prophet said; 'Sell him to me.' So he bought him for two black slaves, then he did not accept until he had asked; 'Is he a slave?'''

# Violence

See also [Jihad](#jihad), [Muhammad and violence](#muhammad-and-violence).

## Fighting is obligatory 

Surah 2:216

> Fighting has been made obligatory upon you ˹believers˺, though you dislike it. Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know.

Apparently Allah thinks violence is good for humans. 

## Killing unbelievers

Surah 3:151-152

> We will **throw terror into the hearts** of those who have denied because they associated with Allah (partners) for which He bestowed from on high no authority. And their shelter is the Fire, and how miserable is the dwelling of the unjust! And very truly Allah fulfilled His promise to you **as you killed them** by His permission, until when you faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter and disobeyed after He had shown you what you love: …

Allah will use **terror** against unbelievers. By what method? By Muslims **killing them by His permission**. And then Allah will burn them in **the Fire** forever. But is this a coincidence? No, if a Muslims had a shred of humanity and **faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter** whether terrorism is good, Allah sees that as them having **disobeyed** him.

## Kill unbelievers wherever you find them

Surah 4:89

> They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you may all be alike. So do not take them as allies unless they emigrate in the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take any of them as allies or helpers,

Do not befriend unbelievers but **seize them and kill them wherever you find them**.

Surah 4:91

> You will find others who wish to be safe from you and their own people. Yet they cannot resist the temptation ˹of disbelief or hostility˺. If they do not keep away, offer you peace, or refrain from attacking you, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. We have given you full permission over such people.

If someone just wants to **be safe from** Islam and just want to live their life in peace and not be bothered, then **seize them and kill them** too.

## Allah likes terrorists more than peaceful Muslims 

Surah 4:95

>  Those believers who stay at home—except those with valid excuses1—are not equal to those who strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives.…

## The penalty for resisting Islam

Surah 5:33

> Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land**. This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.

In case you wage war against Islam, for example by exposing what a horrible ideology it is, your punishment is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land** and then to burn in hell for all eternity.


## Beheading unbelievers

Surah 8:12

> … I will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers. So strike their necks and strike their fingertips.”

Ever wondered why Islamic terrorists behead their victims? It's by the book.

## Not fighting for Islam is punished with hell

Surah 8:15-16


> O believers! When you face the disbelievers in battle, never turn your backs to them. And whoever does so on such an occasion—unless it is a manoeuvre or to join their own troops—will earn the displeasure of Allah, and their home will be Hell. What an evil destination!

A Muslim who chickens out and turns his back on a disbeliever will go to hell.

## Behead enemies

[Quran 47:4](https://quran.com/47?startingVerse=4&translations=149)

> Thus, when you encounter those who have denied, strike at their necks. Then when you have subjugated them, bind them firmly…

## Plundering is ok if no one is watching

[Sahih al Bukhari 6772](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6772)

> … when a robber robs and the people look at him, then he is not a believer at the time of doing it.…

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3936](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3936)

> …the plunderer, at the time he is plundering with the people looking on, is not a believer.

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3935](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3935)

> “Whoever plunders openly is not one of us.”

So plundering only makes a Muslim a nonbeliever under the condition that they do it openly when someone is watching. If it's done in secret it's no problem.


# Weird or miscellaneous 

## "The eyes are the leather strap of the anus"

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 203](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:203)

> The Messenger of Allah  said: The eyes are the leather strap of the anus, so one who sleeps should perform ablution.

## Moses had his clothes stolen by a stone

[Sahih al Bukhari 278](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:278)

> ...once Moses went out to take a bath and put his clothes over a stone and then that stone ran away with his clothes. Moses followed that stone saying, "My clothes, O stone! My clothes, O stone!...

## Unbelievers visiting a mosque will go to hell

Surah 9:17-18

> Never was it befitting for the polytheists to attend Allah’s mosques while professing their denial. Those—their deeds were nullified, and in the Fire they abide.Surely, Allah’s mosques can only be attended by one who has attained faith in Allah…

## Muslims living abroad goes to hell

> When the angels seize the souls of those who have wronged themselves — scolding them, “What was wrong with you?” they will reply, “We were oppressed in the land.” The angels will respond, “Was Allah’s earth not spacious enough for you to emigrate?” It is they who will have Hell as their home—what an evil destination!

When muslims who live outside of Islamic countries (i.e. them being **opressed in the land**) die, the angel of death will scold them for not living in an Islamic country (i.e. **Allah’s earth**), and send them to hell.

## Snakes in houses may be demons who converted to islam {#snake-jinn}

This teaching is spread out over many Hadiths, but pieced together the gist is: 

Muhammad said that you should kill snakes outside, but if you find a snake inside your house you shouldn't kill it right away. The story goes that a young man found a snake in his house and pierced it with his spear, but it attacked and killed him. People asked Muhammad to pray that he be resurrected but he said that snakes found in houses are jinns (demons) and that some jinns have accepted Islam and become Muslims. So if you find a snake in your house it could be a fellow Muslim, and therefore you should command it to not hurt you but to leave for three days. If it doesn't obey by the fourth day, it's a devil and you should kill it.

## Deathbed convert couldn't be buried

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3930](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3930)

> …[In battle, a] man … attacked an idolator man with a spear, and when he was defeated he said: “I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, I am a Muslim.” But he stabbed him and killed him…We buried him, but the following morning he was on the surface of the earth. They said: “Perhaps an enemy of his disinterred him.” So we buried him (again) and told our slaves to stand guard. But the following morning he was on the surface of the earth again then we said: ‘Perhaps the slaves dozed off.’ So we buried him (again) and stood guard ourselves, but the following morning he was on the surface of the earth (again). So we threw him into one of these mountain passes.’”

Apparently it was impossible to keep this deathbed convert in the ground, so they did the only sensible thing and **threw him into one of these mountain passes**. As you do.

## It's ok for a man to beat his wife

Surah 4:34

> Men stand caretakers of women since Allah has made some of them excel the others, and because they have spent of their wealth., So, the righteous women are obedient, guarding in absence with the protection given by Allah. As for women whose disobedience you fear, convince them, and leave them apart in beds, and **beat them**. Then, if they obey you, do not seek a way against them. Surely, Allah is the Highest, the Greatest.

This is if a man even only fears his wife would be disobedient.

## Women are to be plowed like a field

Surah 2:223 

> Your wives are your fields, so go into your fields whichever way you like

## No women has it worse than Muslim women

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5825](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5825)
 
> Rifa'a divorced his wife whereupon AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. Aisha said that the lady came, wearing a green veil and complained to her (Aisha) of her husband and showed her a green spot on her skin caused by beating. It was the habit of ladies to support each other, so when Allah's Messenger came, Aisha said, "I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women. Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!"…

Even Aisha, the "mother of the believers", admits that no women are treated as poorly as Muslim women. This muslima was beaten so severely that her bruises were greener than her green veil.

## It's ok to marry and divorce girls who have not yet menstruated

Surah 65:4

Context from Surah 65:1:

> O Prophet! ˹Instruct the believers:˺ **When you intend to˺ divorce women, then divorce them with concern for their waiting period**...

There's a waiting period a divorced woman has to wait before she can remarry.  

> As for your women past the age of menstruation, in case you do not know, their waiting period is three months, **and those who have not menstruated as well**. As for those who are pregnant, their waiting period ends with delivery. And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make their matters easy for them.

This means men are allowed to marry and divorce prepubescent girls.

## The majority of people in hell are women

[Sahih al Bukhari 304](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:304)

> Once Allah's Messenger  went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) of 'Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by the women and said, "O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women)." …

## Women are mentally deficient 

[Sahih al Bukhari 2658](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2658)
