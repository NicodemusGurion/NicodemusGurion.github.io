Some selected Quran and Hadith verses.

[TOC]

# Adam

## Adam was 60 cubits tall

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their form would be alike as one single person after the form of their father (Adam) sixty cubits tall.

1 Arabic cubit was traditionally 64 cm long, which means Adam would be 38.4 meters tall.

# Allah

## Allah prays

[Al Adan Al Mufrad 645](https://sunnah.com/adab:645)

> Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If anyone prays once on me, Allah will pray ten times on him.'"

Who is Allah praying to?

## Allah is a narcissist 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4634](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4634)

> And none loves to be praised more than Allah does, and for this reason He praises Himself.

## Allah wonders 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3010](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3010)

> The Prophet said, "Allah wonders at those people who will enter Paradise in chains."

Apparently there are things that surprise Allah. How could someone supposedly all-knowing wonder about anything?

## Allah is limited to one location

[Quran 20:5](https://quran.com/20/5)

> the Most Compassionate, Who is˺ established on the Throne.

## Allah comes down every night

[Sahih Muslim 758b](https://sunnah.com/muslim:758b)

> Allah descends every night to the lowest heaven when one-third of the first part of the night is over (3 am) and says: I am the Lord; I am the Lord: who is there to supplicate Me so that I answer him? Who is there to beg of Me so that I grant him? Who is there to beg forgiveness from Me so that I forgive him? He continues like this till the day breaks.

Allah doesn't know how time zones work. If he comes down every night at  3am, and leave at daybreak, in what time zone is he? It would mean that in one time zone he is descending while in another time zone he is ascending, at the same time. Therefore Allah is always somewhere in our atmosphere at all times, yet he is unable to enter our world, and he is [also located on his throne?](#allah-is-limited-to-one-location) How does it work?

## Allah deceives

[Quran 8:43,44](https://quran.com/8/43-44?translations=149)

> Recall: Allah showing them to you in your sleep as few, for had He showed them to you as many, you would have faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter, but Allah saved (the situation). He is indeed All-Knowing of what lies within the chests. And recall: when you met, Him showing them to you as few in your eyes and making you appear fewer in their eyes, so that Allah might carry out a predetermined matter. And to Allah all matters are returned.

Allah deceived Muhammad to go into battle against a large army, making him think it was a small army. He also deceived his enemies in the same way.

[Quran4:157](https://quran.com/4/157?translations=149)

> and their saying, “We have surely killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah. ”In fact, they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them as if they had. And indeed, those who differed over him are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it—just following assumptions. And certainly, they did not kill him.

Allah deceived the Jews and Romans into thinking they killed Jesus. Allah is deceptive.

This is also a verse that proves Islam is historically false, for the crucifixion of Jesus is the most well documented event in ancient history.

# Animals

## Owning a dog gives you minus points {#owning-a-dog}

[Sahih al Bukhari 5480](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5480)

> Narrated Ibn Umar: The Prophet said, "Whoever keeps a (pet) dog which is neither a watch dog nor a hunting dog, will get a daily deduction of two Qirat from his good deeds."

# Apostasy 

## Punishment for apostasy is being stoned to death {#apostasy-death-sentence}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2535](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2535)

> It was narrated from Ibn'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah said:
> “Whoever changes his religion, execute him.”

- [Sunan Ibn Majah 2533](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2533)
- [Sunan Ibn Majah 2534](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2534)

# Contradictions

[Quran 4:82](https://quran.com/4/82)

> Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Had it been from anyone other than Allah, they would have certainly found in it many inconsistencies.

If the Quran is from Allah, there should be no contradictions.

## How long did it take Allah to create the world?

Was it 6 days or 8 days?

[Quran 10:3](https://quran.com/10/3)

> Surely your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days,...

[Quran 41:9-12](https://quran.com/41?startingVerse=9)

Allah created the heavens and the earth in 6 days.

> Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “How can you disbelieve in the One Who created the earth in two Days? And how can you set up equals with Him? That is the Lord of all worlds. He placed on the earth firm mountains, standing high, showered His blessings upon it, and ordained ˹all˺ its means of sustenance—totaling four Days exactly1—for all who ask. ... So He formed the heaven into seven heavens in two Days, assigning to each its mandate. ... 

2 + 4 + 2 = 8. Allah created the heavens and the earth in 8 days.

# Factual errors 

Historical and factual errors 

## Jews think Ezra is the son of Allah {#ezra-son-of-allah}

[Quran 9:30](https://quran.com/9/31)

> The Jews say, “Ezra is the son of Allah,” and the Christians say, “The Messiah is the son of Allah.” These are mere words that they utter, imitating the words of the disbelievers before them. May Allah ruin them; how can they be deluded?

No Jews have ever claimed that Ezra is the son of God. How deluded is Muhammad to believe in such nonsense?

## Christians worship Mary

*Christians don't worship Mary. But Allah doesn't know this*.

[Quran 5:116](https://quran.com/5/116)

> And ˹on Judgment Day˺ Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Did you ever ask the people to worship you and your mother as gods besides Allah?”...

## Mary the mother of Jesus is the brother of Aaron {#who-is-mary}

*Mary the mother of Jesus lived in first century Judaea/Galilee. Mariam the sister of Aaron lived about 1500 years before her in Egypt/Sinai. Allah does not know that these are two different people.*

[Quran 19:27,28](https://quran.com/19?startingVerse=27)

> Then she returned to her people, carrying him [Jesus]. They said ˹in shock˺, “O Mary! You have certainly done a horrible thing! O  sister of Aaron! Your father was not an indecent man, nor was your mother unchaste.”

## Pharao ordered Haman to build the Tower of Babel {#pharao-haman-tower}

[Quran 40:36](https://quran.com/40?startingVerse=36)

> Pharaoh ordered, “O Hamân! Build me a high tower so I may reach the pathways leading up to the heavens and look for the God of Moses, although I am sure he is a liar.” And so Pharaoh’s evil deeds were made so appealing to him that he was hindered from the ˹Right˺ Way. But the plotting of Pharaoh was only in vain.

The Pharao was the king of Egypt. Haman was an Amalekite man, an enemy of Israel, who lived in the Persian empire in the 5th century BC. And the Tower of Babel was built on the plains of Mesopotamia in the 24th century BC. This is the worst imaginable mishmash of stories and characters.

## Pharao threatened people with crucifixion {#egyptian-crucifixion}

[Quran 7:123,124](https://quran.com/7/123-124)

> Pharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission? This must be a conspiracy you devised in the city to drive out its people, but soon you will see. I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then crucify you all.”

Crucifixion was never used by ancient Egypt, and did not become a common form of execution by the Romans in the 6th century BC.

## The Israelites were misled by a Samaritan {#misled-by-samaritan}

[Quran 20:85](https://quran.com/20/85)

> Allah responded, “We have indeed tested your people in your absence, and the Samaritan has led them astray .

The Samaritan people did not exist until at least a thousand years after the event where the Israelites were misled into worshipping the golden calf.

## Jesus was not crucified 

[Quran4:157](https://quran.com/4/157?translations=149)

> and their saying, “We have surely killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah. ”In fact, they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them as if they had. And indeed, those who differed over him are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it—just following assumptions. And certainly, they did not kill him.

That Jesus was crucified by order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate is subject to "almost universal assent" among scholars. Lightfoot Professor of Divinity James Dunn stated that the fact of the baptism and crucifixion of Jesus "rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts, they are obvious starting points for an attempt to clarify the what and why of Jesus' mission." Atheist scholar Bart Ehrman says "Nearly all critical scholars agree at least on those points about the historical Jesus."

In other words, the Quran is historically false.

# Health and hygiene

## Muslims aren’t allowed to urinate standing {#no-urinating-standing}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 308](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:308) 

> It was narrated that 'Umar said: "The Messenger of Allah saw me urinating while standing, and he said: 'O 'Umar, do not urinate standing up.' So I never urinated whilst standing after that."

## Muslims aren’t allowed to urinate in water {#no-urinating-in-water}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 343](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:343) 

> It was narrated from Jabir that: The Messenger of Allah forbade urinating into standing water.

So it seems our Muslim brothers can not urinate into a water toilet, especially not standing up.

Also: 

- [Sahih Muslim 281](https://sunnah.com/muslim:281)

## Dogs would urinate in the mosque and no one would clean it up

[Sahih al-Bukhari 174](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:174)

> And narrated Hamza bin 'Abdullah:
> My father said. "During the lifetime of Allah's Apostle, the dogs used to urinate, and pass through the mosques (come and go), nevertheless they never used to sprinkle water on it (urine of the dog.)"


# Jews

## The verse they use to lie that Islam is peaceful 

[Quran 5:32](https://quran.com/5/32)

> That is why We ordained **for the Children of Israel** that whoever takes a life—**unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land**—it will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity.1 ˹Although˺ Our messengers already came to them with clear proofs, many of them still transgressed afterwards through the land.

This verse is often quoted by Muslims doing Taqqiya to say that Islam is peaceful. But as you can see, it is a command directed to the people of Israel, not Muslims. 

It is a quotation from the Talmud. So the Quran is actually saying that the commentary by a rabbi in the Talmud is "revelation from Allah."

Also notice that this command has the stipulation "unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land", meaning that Jews had the right of capital punishment for those spreading mischief in the land. But in other cases, killing one would be like killing all. 

And what "land" is it talking about? Well, the land of the Jews, Israel, or Palestine as it was later renamed. 

*So according to the Quran, the Jews has the right to execute capital punishment on those spreading mischief in the land of Israel (Palestine).*

But wait, it gets better. The next verse is what applies to Muslims:

[Quran 5:33](https://quran.com/5/33)

> Indeed, the penalty **for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger** and spread mischief in the land is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land.** This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous **punishment in the Hereafter.**

This is directed to Muslims, how to deal with those who "who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land". The Muslims are to kill, crucify, dismember and exile people. And after they die, Allah sends them to hell."

## Islam's Final Solution to the Jewish Question {#final-solution}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2926](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2926)

> Allah's Messenger said, "The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."

# Jihad

## Jizya

[Sahih Muslim 1731a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1731a)

> …If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them.…

This is the future of your country if you invite Islam: They will sooner or later take over, and if you do not join their ideology, you will have to pay a tax to them. And if you refuse to pay them, they will kill you.

## Even stones will help jihadists to kill Jews 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2926](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2926)

> Allah's Messenger said, "The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."

## Muslims can indiscriminately kill innocent civilians 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3012](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012)

> The Prophet … was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, "They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)." I also heard the Prophet saying, "The institution of Hima (sanctuary) is invalid except for Allah and His Apostle."

So his men, having a shred of humanity, asked about the possibility of killing non-combatant women and children. Muhammad said that it doesn't matter, they're all the same, so it's ok to kill innocent civilians. 

### "Hima"

In the context of warfare in Islamic teachings, the term "hima" is sometimes used to denote a protected zone or area during times of conflict. It signifies a space where civilians and their property are safeguarded from harm. The Prophet Muhammad emphasized the importance of protecting Muslim non-combatants, including women, children, and the elderly, and avoiding unnecessary destruction during warfare. As pointed out in [Sahih al-Bukhari 3012](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012), Hima is invalid for non-Muslims though. Muslims do not need to care about innocent bystanders but can just go on killing women and children indiscriminately.

## Fight until unbelievers convert

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6924, 6925](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6924)

> …Allah's Messenger said, 'I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, ' and whoever said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah', Allah will save his property and his life from me…

# Mohammad

Things that Mohammad did.

## Muhammad was a pedophile

### Mohammed married 6 year old Aisha {#child-sexual-abuse}

Aisha, the favorite wife of Muhammad, was 6 years old when Muhammad married her, and he had sex with their when she was only 9 years old. She was prepubescent, still playing with dolls together with her playmates. Dolls are usually forbidden but we're allowed for Aisha since she was a "little girl" so young that normal Islamic rules didn't yet apply to her.

[Sunna an Nasa'i 3378](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3378)

> "The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls."

[Sahih al Bukhari 6130](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130)

> Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger  used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was **a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.**) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)

### Muhammed used to put his face into Aishas crotch and recite Quran verses when she was menstruating {#crotch-talk}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 634](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:634)

> It was narrated that 'Aishah said: "The Messenger of Allah used to put his head in my lap when I was menstruating and recite Qur'an."

### Muhammad used to fondle Aisha when she was menstruating {#fondling-aisha}

[Sahih al Bukhari 299](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:299)

> Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet  and I used to take a bath from a single pot while we were Junub. During the menses, he used to order me to put on an Izar (dress worn below the waist) and used to fondle me. While in I'tikaf, he used to bring his head near me and I would wash it while I used to be in my periods (menses).

### Muhammad was baffled that other men were not pedophiles like him

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5080](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5080)

> Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:
> When I got married, Allah's Messenger said to me, "What type of lady have you married?" I replied, "I have married a matron' He said, "Why, don't you have a liking for the virgins and for fondling them?" Jabir also said: Allah's Messenger said, "Why didn't you marry a young girl so that you might play with her and she with you?'

### Muhammad believed silence meant consent

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5137](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5137)

> Narrated Aisha:
> I said, "O Allah's Messenger! A virgin feels shy." He said, "Her consent is (expressed by) her silence."

A true rape culture.

## Muhammad and family

### Muhammad would not provide more than one garment each to his wives {#miserly-husband}

[Sahih al Bukhari 312](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:312)

> Narrated 'Aisha: None of us had more than a single garment and we used to have our menses while wearing it. Whenever it got soiled with blood of menses we used to apply saliva to the blood spot and rub off the blood with our nails.

When they had menstrual blood stain their garments they would have to clean them with spit.

### A wife of Muhammad used a dish to catch yellow menstrual discharge while praying {#discharge-dish}

[Sahih al Bukhari 310](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:310)

> Narrated 'Aisha: "One of the wives of Allah's Messenger  joined him in I'tikaf and she noticed blood and yellowish discharge (from her private parts) and put a dish under her when she prayed."

### Muhammad daughter Fatima was denied an inheritance {#daughter-no-inheritance}

Instead they had to go to Abu Bakr to get what they needed to survive as a charity.

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 2969](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2969)

> Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin: Fatimah was demanding (the property of) sadaqah of the Messenger of Allah  at Medina and Fadak, and what remained from the fifth of Khaybar. Aisha quoted AbuBakr as saying: The Messenger of Allah  said: We are not inherited; whatever we leave is sadaqah (charity). The family of Muhammad will eat from this property, that is, from the property of Allah. They will not take more then their sustenance.

### The wives of Muhammad were also denied an inheritance. {#wives-no-inheritance}

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 2976](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2976)

> Narrated 'Aishah: When the Messenger of Allah  died, the wives of the Prophet  intended to send 'Uthman b. 'Affan to Abu Bakr to ask him their cost of living from (the inheritance of) the Prophet . Thereupon 'Aishah said: Did not the Messenger of Allah  say: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah (charity).

### The parents of Muhammad are in hell {#parents-in-hell}

[Sahih Muslim 976b](https://sunnah.com/muslim/11/135)

> Abu Huraira reported: The Apostle of Allah  visited the grave of his mother and he wept, and moved others around him to tears, and said: **I sought permission from my Lord to beg forgiveness for her but it was not granted to me**, and I sought permission to visit her grave and it was granted to me so visit the graves, for that makes you mindful of death.

Muhammad was not allowed to ask forgiveness for his mother, meaning Allah will not forgive her, meaning she is in hell.

[Sunan Abu Dawud 4718](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4718)

> Anas said : A man asked : where is my father, Messenger of Allah? He replied! Your father is in Hell. When he turned his back, he said : **My father and your father are in Hell.**

Muhammad's father is in hell.

## Muhammad and water

### Muhammad told his followers to drink sewer water {#sewer-water}

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 67](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:67)

> Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri: I heard that the people asked the Prophet of Allah : Water is brought for you from the well of Buda'ah. It is a well in which dead dogs, menstrual clothes and excrement of people are thrown. The Messenger of Allah  replied: Verily water is pure and is not defiled by anything...

[Sunnan Ibn Majah 520](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:520)

> "We came to a pond in which there was the carcass of a donkey, so we refrained from using the water until the Messenger of Allah came to us and said: 'Water is not made impure by anything.' Then we drank from it and gave it to our animals to drink, and we carried some with us."

To say that water is not defiled by anything, not even the rotting corpses of dogs and donkeys, menstrual waste products and literal feces is insane and unscientific. This unhygienic idea has probably cost the lives of untold numbers of people throughout history.

### Muhammad gargled with dick water {#dick-water}

[Sahih al Bukhari 274](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:274)

> Water was placed for the ablution of Allah's Messenger after Janaba. He poured water with his right hand over his left twice or thrice and then washed his private parts and rubbed his hand on the earth or on a wall twice or thrice and then rinsed his mouth, washed his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out...

Notice that after washing his private parts he uses the same water to rinse his mouth and nose.

### Muhammad had sex with 11 wives and only took one bath {#unwashed-sex}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 589](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:589)

> "I put out water for the Messenger of Allah for a bath, and he had a bath after going to all of his wives in one night."

([Muhammad had 11 wives at the same time](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:268))

- [Sunnan Abu Dawud 218](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:218)

## Muhammad and saliva

### Muhammad told his followers to lick each other's hands {#licking-hands}

[Sahih al Bukhari 5456](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5456)

> Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: The Prophet  said, 'When you eat, do not wipe your hands till you have licked it, or had it licked by somebody else."

### Muhammad spit three times in a man's wound {#spitting-in-wounds}

[Sahih al Bukhari 4206](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4206)

> I saw the trace of a wound in Salama's leg. I said to him, "O Abu Muslim! What is this wound?" He said, "This was inflicted on me on the day of Khaibar and the people said, 'Salama has been wounded.' Then I went to the Prophet  and he puffed his saliva in the wound thrice., and since then I have not had any pain in it till this hour."

### Muhammad believed spit mixed with dirt could cure illnesses {#spit-and-dirt}

[Sahih al Bukhari 5745](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5745)

> Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet  used to say to the patient, "In the Name of Allah The earth of our land and the saliva of some of us cure our patient."

- [Riyad as-Salihin 901](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:901)
- [Sunnan Ibn Majah 3521](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3521)

### Muhammad tried to heal himself by blowing raspberries {#blowing-raspberries}

[Mishkat al-Masabih 1532](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:1532)

> She said that when the Prophet had a complaint he would blow on himself, ejecting saliva, reciting the Mu'awwidhah, and wipe himself with his hand. She said, “When he suffered from the pain of which he died, I would blow on him ejecting saliva and recite the Mu'awwidhat as he did, and would take the Prophet’s hand to wipe him.”  

### Muhammad spat in the mouth of a newborn child {#spitting-in-mouth-of-child}

[Sahih al Bukhari 5469](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5469)

> I conceived 'Abdullah bin AzZubair at Mecca and went out (of Mecca) while I was about to give birth. I came to Medina and encamped at Quba', and gave birth at Quba'. Then I brought the child to Allah's Messenger  and placed it (on his lap). He asked for a date, chewed it, and put his saliva in the mouth of the child. So the first thing to enter its stomach was the saliva of Allah's Messenger

### Muhammad exhumed a dead man and spat in his mouth {#spitting-in-mouth-of-dead}

[Sahih Muslim 2773a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2773a)

> Jabir reported Allah's Apostle  came to the grave of 'Abdullah b. Ubayy, brought him out from that, placed him on his knee and put his saliva in his mouth and shrouded him in his own shirt and Allah knows best.

## Muhammad and urine

### Muhammad urinated squatting

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 29](https://sunnah.com/nasai:29)

> Whoever tells you that the Messenger of Allah urinated standing up, do not believe him, for he would not urinate except while squatting."

### Muhammad urinated standing

[Sahih al Bukhari 2471](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2471)

> Narrated Hudhaifa: I saw Allah's Messenger coming to the dumps of some people and urinated there while standing.

It seems that Hudhaifa [contradicts Aisha](#muhammad-urinated-squatting) and that [Muhammad didn't practice what he taught](#no-urinating-standing)

### Muhammad urinated in some weird way

[Sunan Ibn Majah 341](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:341)

> It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said: "The Messenger of Allah turned towards a mountain pass and urinated, until I took pity on him because of the way he parted his legs when he urinated."

### Muhammad prohibited urinating in holes {#urinating-in-holes}

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 29](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:29)

> The Prophet prohibited to urinate in a hole.
> Qatadah (a narrator) was asked about the reason for the disapproval of urinating in a hole. He replied: It is said that these (holes) are the habitats of the jinn.

### Muhammad prescribed the drinking of camel urine {#drinking-camel-urine}

[Mishkat al-Masabih 3539](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:3539)

> Anas told that some people of ‘Ukl who had come to the Prophet and accepted Islam found Medina unhealthy, so he ordered them to go to the camels of the sadaqa and drink some of their urine...

[He later tortured these people to death.](#tortured-to-death)

### Muhammad prohibited urinating towards the qibla {#urinating-toward-qibla}

[Sunnan Ibn Majah 325](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:325)

> "The Messenger of Allah forbade facing the Qiblah when urinating. But I saw him, one year before he died, facing the Qiblah (while urinating)."

Hypocrite.

## Muhammad and other bodily fluids

### Muhammad wore semen encrusted clothes {#semen-clothes}

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 372](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:372)

> I used to rub off the semen from the clothes of the Messenger of Allah. He would would pray in it.

I can imagine this poor girl walking after this old man, rubbing dried up semen stains out of his clothes with her finger nail while he's on his way to the mosque.

## Muhammad and violence

### Muhammad tortured people to death {#tortured-to-death}

[Mishkat al-Masabih 3539](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:3539)

> … So he sent people in pursuit of them, and when they were brought he had their hands and feet cut off and their eyes put out and left them to die without cauterising them to stop the flow of blood. A version says nails were driven into their eyes. Another says he ordered nails to be heated and after having them blinded with them he had them thrown out on the harra, and although they begged for water they were left to die without being given any.

These people had stolen some camels so Muhammad **had their hands and feet cut off and their eyes put out** with white hot nails, and then left them to die from thirst and bleeding out.

### Muhammad personally stoned a woman

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2555](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2555)

> a woman came to the Prophet and confessed to committing fornication. He issued orders, and her garments were tightened around her (so that her private parts would not become uncovered) then he stoned her, then he offered the funeral prayer for her.

In contrast Jesus defended a woman against being stoned for adultery. (John 8:1-11)

### Muhammad was a terrorist

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2977](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2977)

> ...I have been made victorious with terror (cast in the hearts of the enemy)...

## Muhammad's mental and spiritual health

### Muhammad was bewitched

[Sahih Al Bukhari 3268](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3268)

> Magic was worked on the Prophet so that he began to fancy that he was doing a thing which he was not actually doing. One day he invoked (Allah) for a long period and then said, "I feel that Allah has inspired me as how to cure myself. Two persons came to me (in my dream) and sat, one by my head and the other by my feet. One of them asked the other, "What is the ailment of this man?" The other replied, 'He has been bewitched"...

[Sahih Al Bukhari 5765 provides more detail:](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5765)

> Magic was worked on Allah's Messenger  so that he used to think that he had sexual relations with his wives while he actually had not...

### Muhammad was suicidal

[Sahih al Bukhari 91](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/91)

> …the Prophet  became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear before him and say, "O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah's Messenger  in truth" whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he had said before.

### Muhammad was paranoid, accusing a child of being a supervillain {#dajjal}

The Dajjal is an evil figure in Islamic eschatology who will pretend to be the promised Messiah and later claim to be God, appearing before the Day of Judgment according to the Islamic eschatological narrative. Muhammad harassed, stalked, and spread rumors about a young boy, saying he was this Dajjal, making him depressed and suicidal.

[Sahih Muslim 2930 a, 2931, 169 d](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2930a)

> [Muhammad went] to Ibn Sayyad … he found him playing with children … Allah's Messenger struck his back with his hands. Allah's Messenger said: Ibn Sayyad, don't you bear witness that I am the messenger of Allah? Ibn Sayyad looked toward him and he said: I bear witness to the fact that you [are] the messenger of the unlettered. … 'Umar b. Khattab said: Allah's Messenger, permit me that I should [behead him]. Thereupon Allah's Messenger said: If he is the same (Dajjal) who would appear near the Last Hour, you would not be able to overpower him, and if he is not that there is no good for you to kill him. 

There was some back and forth banter. But since this boy didn't play along with Muhammad's delusions, Muhammad insinuated that he is the Dajjal.

> after some time Allah's Messenger … went towards the palm trees where Ibn Sayyad was. When [he] went near the tree he hid himself behind a tree with the intention of hearing something from Ibn sayyad before Ibn Sayyad could see him, but Allah's Messenger saw him on a bed with a blanket around him … and Ibn Sayyad's mother saw Allah's Messenger behind the trunk of the palm tree. She said … here is Muhammad. Thereupon Ibn Sayyad jumped up …

So Muhammed is actually stalking a sleeping young boy, trying to eavesdrop to confirm his suspicion that this boy is a supervillain.

> then [Muhammad] made a mention of the Dajjal and said: …(the Dajjal) is one-eyed and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is not one-eyed.…

It would appear that perhaps Ibn Saiyad was one-eyed, because suddenly Muhammad starts spreading a rumour that the Dajjal is one-eyes, and for the rest of his life, Ibn Saiyad had to live with this rumour. Because of this, the boy grew up to be depressed and suicidal.

[Sahih Muslim 2927c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2927c)

> …lbn Saiyad was along with us. … I felt terribly frightend from him as it was said about him that he was the Dajjal. He brought his goods and placed them by my luggage and I said: It is intense heat. Would you not place that under that tree? And he did that. Then there appeared before us a flock of sheep. He went and brought a cup of milk and said: Abu Said, drink that. I said it is intense heat and the milk is also hot (whereas the fact was) that I did not like to drink from his hands or to take it from his hand and he said: Abu Said, I think that I should take a rope and suspend it by the tree and then commit suicide because of the talks of the people…

Abu Said, like most people, were afraid of Ibn Saiyad because of the rumor started by Muhammad, so he tried to avoid him. Ibn Saiyad, having been ostracized like that his whole life said that it made him want to hang himself.

## The death of Muhammad

### How did Muhammad die?

#### Allah promises to cut off his aorta if he tells a lie {#cutting-aorta}

[Quran 69:44-47](https://quran.com/69/44-47)

> Had the Messenger made up something in Our Name, We would have certainly seized him by his right hand, then severed his aorta, and none of you could have shielded him ˹from Us˺!

[Musnad Ahmad 107](https://sunnah.com/ahmad:107)

> And if he (Muhammad ﷺ) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah). We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), And then **We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta)**, And none of you could have withheld Us from (punishing) him...”

So Allah promises that Muhammed ever acts as a false prophet, Allah will cut off his aorta.

#### Muhammad eats a poisoned lamb {#poisoned-lamb}

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 4512](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4512)

> Narrated Abu Hurairah: ...So a Jewess presented him at Khaybar with a roasted sheep which she had poisoned. The Messenger of Allah  ate of it and the people also ate. He then said: Take away your hands (from the food), for it has informed me that it is poisoned. Bishr ibn al-Bara' ibn Ma'rur al-Ansari died. So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess (and said to her): What motivated you to do the work you have done? She said: If you were a prophet, it would not harm you; but if you were a king, I should rid the people of you. The Messenger of Allah  then ordered regarding her and she was killed. He then said about the pain of which he died: I continued to feel pain from the morsel which I had eaten at Khaybar. This is the time when **it has cut off my aorta.** 

See also:

- [Sunnah Abu Dawud 4508](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4508)
- [Sunnah Abu Dawud 4510](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4510)

After Muhammad kills the whole male Jewish population of Khaibar, a Jewish woman offers him roasted lamb. Being arguably the dumbest person in history, Muhammad accepts it. And it turns out that it was poisoned. Some of his men died, but Muhammad was affected for a long time from the lingering poison. Notice that Muhammad is saying that the pain from the poison feels like it is cutting off his aorta.

#### Muhammad dies from having his aorta cut {#muhammad-dies}

[Sahih al Bukhari 4428](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4428)
  
> Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet  in his ailment in which he died, used to say, "O `Aisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, **I feel as if my aorta is being cut** from that poison."

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 4513](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4513)

> ...I do not think about the illness of my son except the poisoned sheep of which he had eaten with you at Khaybar. The Prophet  said: And I do not think about my illness except that. **This is the time when it cut off my aorta**...

Muhammad eventually died from the poisoned lamb of a jewish woman, and he did so while complaining that he felt as if his aorta was being cut. This is exactly how Allah said he would die if he was a false prophet.

Notice also the poetic biblical references in that a false anti-christ prophet was killed by Allah after eating of the Lamb that came from a Jewish woman.

### What was the last orders of Muhammad to his followers? {#last-orders}

> Ibn 'Abbas said... The Prophet on his death-bed, gave three orders saying, "Expel the pagans from the Arabian Peninsula, respect and give gifts to the foreign delegates as you have seen me dealing with them." I forgot the third (order)"...

What's that, Ibn Abbas? The last order of Muhammad wasn't noteworthy enough to even commit to memory? But at least you remembered the genocide part.

### What was the last words of Muhammad? {#last-words}

While Jesus used his last moments to forgive his enemies, Muhammad used his last moments to curse one third of the world population.

[Sahih Muslim 531](https://sunnah.com/muslim:531)

>  'A'isha and Abdullah reported: As the Messenger of Allah  was about to breathe his last, he drew his sheet upon his face and when he felt uneasy, he uncovered his face and said in that very state: Let there be curse upon the Jews and the Christians that they have taken the graves of their apostles as places of worship. He in fact warned (his men) against what they (the Jews and the Christians) did.

### What was the last action of Muhammad? {#last-actions}

Sharing a toothbrush with two other people.

[Sahih al Bukhari 4450](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4450)

> Aisha added, "The Prophet  expired on the day of my turn in my house and he was taken unto Allah while his head was against my chest and his saliva mixed with my saliva." 'Aisha added, "Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr came in, carrying a Siwak he was cleaning his teeth with. Allah's Messenger  looked at it and I said to him, 'O 'AbdurRahman! Give me this Siwak.' So he gave it to me and I cut it, chewed it (it's end) and gave it to Allah's Messenger  who cleaned his teeth with it while he was resting against my chest."

## Muhammad didn't like garlic {#garlic}

[Sahih al Bukhari 5451](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5451)

> Narrated `Abdul `Aziz: It was said to Anas "What did you hear the Prophet  saying about garlic?" Anas replied, "Whoever has eaten (garlic) should not approach our mosque."

## Muhammad was the first Muslim

[Quran 6:14](https://quran.com/6/14)

> Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Will I take any guardian other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who provides for all and is not in need of provision?” Say, “I have been commanded to be the first to submit and not be one of the polytheists.”

## Allah considered Muhammad the perfect example

[Quran 33:21](https://quran.com/33/21)

> Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for whoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah often.

[Quran 68:4](https://quran.com/68/4)

> And you are truly a man of outstanding character.

# Paradise

The Islamic paradise is a very physical place where people will eat fruit that all tastes the same. Then they will not poop, but belch out the excrement as musk.

## All fruit looks the same in paradise {#boring-fruit}

[Quran 2:25](https://quran.com/2/25)

> And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens under which rivers flow. Every time they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” for they will be given fruit that resemble one another. They will have purified spouses, and they will abide therein forever.

## Paradise dwellers don't poop but belch and sweat musk {#belching-musk}

> I heard Allah's Apostle as saying that the inmates of Paradise would eat and drink but would neither spit, nor pass water, nor void excrement, nor suffer catarrah. It was said: Then, what would happen with food? Thereupon he said: They would belch and sweat (and it would be over with their food), and their sweat would be that of musk and they would glorify and praise Allah as easily as you breathe.

> It is He Who created for you all that is in the earth, then He turned towards the heaven and made them seven heavens...

# Prayer

## Looking up while praying makes you go blind {#praying-looking-up-blind}

[Sahih al Bukhari 750](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:750)

> The Prophet said, "What is wrong with those people who look towards the sky during the prayer?" His talk grew stern while delivering this speech and he said, "They should stop (looking towards the sky during the prayer); otherwise their eyesight would be taken away."

## Looking up while praying turns your head into a donkey head {#praying-looking-up-donkey}

[Sahih al Bukhari 691](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:691)

> The Prophet said, "Isn't he who raises his head before the Imam afraid that Allah may transform his head into that of a donkey or his figure into that of a donkey?"

# The Quran

## How to know if the Quran is inspired {#quran-inspired}

[Quran 2:23](https://quran.com/2/23)[, 24](https://quran.com/2/24)

> 23 If you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down upon Our slave, then produce a chapter like it and call upon your helpers other than Allah, if you are truthful.24 But if you did not do it, and you can never do it; then beware of the Fire whose fuel will be people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers.

The only claim to inspiration the Quran makes is in its literary excellence, claiming no one can produce a chapter like it. But if you have read it the first thing that strikes you is that literary speaking, it is garbage. Even a mediocre poet would be able to write a chapter far more excellent than most chapters of the Quran.

## The Quran is not perfectly preserved

One miraculous claim made is that the Quran has been perfectly preserved. However the Quran and Hadiths contradict this.

### Allah foretold that the Quran wouldn’t be perfectly preserved 

[Quran 2:106](https://quran.com/2/106)

> If We ever abrogate a verse or **cause it to be forgotten**, We replace it with a better or similar one. Do you not know that Allah is Most Capable of everything?

### Two chapters of the Quran were eaten by a sheep {#sheep-ate-surahs}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 1944](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1944)

> It was narrated that 'Aishah said “The Verse of stoning and of breastfeeding an adult ten times was revealed, and the paper was with me under my pillow. When the Messenger of Allah died, we were preoccupied with his death, and a tame sheep came in and ate it.”

How can the Quran be perfectly preserved when two Surah's were literally eaten by a sheep?

## Chapters of the Quran could be ordered on demand {#surah-on-demand}

[Sahih al Bukhari 4483](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4483)

> I also said, 'O Allah's Messenger ! Good and bad persons visit you! Would that you ordered the Mothers of the believers to cover themselves with veils.' So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were revealed. 

Apparently, chapters could be requested on demand by the followers of Muhammad to suit their personal preferences. How convenient.

## Denying a Quran verse is a capital offense 

> It was narrated from Ibn'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah said:
> “Whoever denies a Verse of the Qur'an, it is permissible to strike his neck (i.e., execute him) 

See also [Apostasy](#apostasy)

# Rape

## It is ok to rape captured women

[Sunan Abi Dawud 2155](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2155)

> Abu Sa’id Al Khudri said “The Apostle of Allaah sent a military expedition to Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain. They met their enemy and fought with them. They defeated them and took them captives. Some of the Companions of Apostle of Allah were reluctant to have relations with the female captives because of their pagan husbands. So, Allaah the exalted sent down the Qur’anic verse “And all married women are forbidden unto you save those captives whom your right hand posses.” This is to say that they are lawful for them when they complete their waiting period.

**Those captives whom your right hand posses** means captives taken in war. The Muslims at this battle, horny perverts though they were, at least had the basic human decency of not raping women in front of their husbands. So this verse that Muhammad conveniently came up with makes it permissible for Muslim men to rape women that they take captive.

[Quran 4:24](https://quran.com/4/24)

> Also ˹forbidden are˺ married women—except ˹female˺ captives in your possession...

## Muslims don't have to worry about getting their rape victims pregnant

[Sahih Muslim 1438a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1438a)

> We went out with Allah's Messenger on the expedition to the Bi'l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing [interrupted coitus]. But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah's Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah's Messenger, and he said: It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born.

Not only are Muslims allowed to rape women, but can just discard them like trash and not bother about them becoming pregnant.

# Salvation 

How are Muslims saved?

## Ransomed from hell by Jews and Christians

[Sahih Muslim 2767 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2767a)

> Abu Musa' reported that Allah's Messenger said:
> When it will be the Day of Resurrection Allah would deliver to every Muslim a Jew or a Christian and say: That is your rescue from Hell-Fire.

Christianity teaches that Jesus is the perfect one who does not deserve hellfire but took this punishment in stead of those who have faith in him. Some Muslims think this is unjust saying that it's wrong that someone should take the punishment for someone else's sin. However here, Allah will let Jews and Christians take the punishment for the sins of Muslims. Is that just, though?

Als this implies that Jews and Christians as not sinners deserving of hell, but that Muslims are sinners deserving of hell. Otherwise, if the Jews and Christians were already in hell, the exchange could not be made.

# Satan

## Satan urinates in your ear

[Sahih al Bukhari 1144](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1144)

> Narrated 'Abdullah: A person was mentioned before the Prophet and he was told that he had kept on sleeping till morning and had not got up for the prayer. The Prophet said, "Satan urinated in his ears."

## Satan farts to not hear the call to prayer {#satan-farts}

[Sahih Muslim 389a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:389a)

> When Satan hears the call to prayer, he turns back and breaks the wind so as not to hear the call being made...

## Yawning is from Satan

[Sahih al Bukhari 3289](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3289)

> Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, "Yawning is from Satan and if anyone of you yawns, he should check his yawning as much as possible, for if anyone of you (during the act of yawning) should say: 'Ha', Satan will laugh at him."

## Satan likes bells

[Sahih Muslim 2114](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2114)

> The bell is the musical instrument of the Satan.

## Muhammad once defeated Satan in a wrestling match

[Sahih al Bukhari 1210](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1210)

> Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, "Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. Then I remembered the statement of Prophet Solomon, 'My Lord ! Bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.' Then Allah made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated)."

# Science

## Sperm comes from between the backbone and the ribs

[Quran 86:6,7](https://quran.com/86?startingVerse=6)

> ˹They were˺ created from a spurting fluid, stemming from between the backbone and the ribcage.

## The sun sets in a muddy spring 

[Quran 18:86](https://quran.com/18/86?translations=17)

> Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a muddy spring, and he found a people at it. We said, "O Thulqarnayn, either you will torment them or you will take to yourself towards them a fair way."

## The earth is flat

[Quran 18:86](https://quran.com/71/19?translations=207)

> Allah has laid the earth out as a carpet for you,

## What determines if a child looks like its mother or father?

[Sahih al Bukhari 3329](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3329)

> If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife and gets discharge first, the child will resemble the father, and if the woman gets discharge first, the child will resemble her.


## The urine of boys and girls are different

[Sunnan Ibn Majah 525](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:525)

> ...He said, "This is because the urine of the boy is of water and clay, but the urine of the girl is of flesh and blood."...

## Non-Muslims eats in seven intestines, Muslims in one {#seven-intestines}

Apparently belief or disbelief in Islam changes the number of intestines you have.

[Sahih Muslim 2060 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2060a)

> Ibn 'Umar reported Allah's Messenger  as saying that a non-Muslim eats in seven intestines whereas a Muslim eats in one intestine.

# Slavery

## Gifting slaves is better than freeing them

[Sahih Muslim 999](https://sunnah.com/muslim:999)

> Maimuna bint Harith reported that she set free a slave-girl during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah and she made a mention of that to the Messenger of Allah and he said: Had you given her to your maternal uncles, you would have a greater reward.

# Violence

## Fighting is obligatory 

[Quran 2:216](https://quran.com/2/216)

> Fighting has been made obligatory upon you ˹believers˺, though you dislike it. Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know.

Apparently Allah thinks violence is good for humans. 

## Killing unbelievers

[Quran 3:151-152](https://quran.com/3/151-152)

> We will throw terror into the hearts of those who have denied because they associated with Allah (partners) for which He bestowed from on high no authority. And their shelter is the Fire, and how miserable is the dwelling of the unjust! And very truly Allah fulfilled His promise to you as you killed them by His permission, until when you faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter and disobeyed after He had shown you what you love: …

Allah will use **terror** against unbelievers. By what method? By Muslims **killing them by His permission**. And then Allah will burn them in **the Fire** forever. But is this a coincidence? No, if a Muslims had a shred of humanity and **faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter** whether terrorism is good, Allah sees that as them having **disobeyed** him.

## Kill unbelievers wherever you find them

[Quran 4:89](https://quran.com/4:89)

> They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you may all be alike. So do not take them as allies unless they emigrate in the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take any of them as allies or helpers,

Do not befriend unbelievers but **seize them and kill them wherever you find them**.

[Quran 4:91](https://quran.com/4:91)

> You will find others who wish to be safe from you and their own people. Yet they cannot resist the temptation ˹of disbelief or hostility˺. If they do not keep away, offer you peace, or refrain from attacking you, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. We have given you full permission over such people.

If someone just wants to **be safe from** Islam and just want to live their life in peace and not be bothered, then **seize them and kill them** too.

## Allah likes terrorists more than peaceful Muslims 

[Quran 4:95](https://quran.com/4:95)

>  Those believers who stay at home—except those with valid excuses1—are not equal to those who strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives.…

## The penalty for resisting Islam

[Quran 5:33](https://quran.com/5:33

> Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land**. This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.

In case you wage war against Islam, for example by exposing what a horrible ideology it is, your punishment is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land** and then to burn in hell for all eternity.


## Beheading unbelievers

[Quran 8:12](https://quran.com/8:12)

> … I will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers. So strike their necks and strike their fingertips.”

Ever wondered why Islamic terrorists behead their victims? It's by the book.

## Not fighting for Islam is punished with hell

> O believers! When you face the disbelievers in battle, never turn your backs to them. And whoever does so on such an occasion—unless it is a manoeuvre or to join their own troops—will earn the displeasure of Allah, and their home will be Hell. What an evil destination!

A Muslim who chickens out and turns his back on a disbeliever will go to hell.

## Behead enemies

[Quran 47:4](https://quran.com/47?startingVerse=4&translations=149)

> …"When one of you breaks his sandal-strap, he should not walk in his other sandal until it is mended."

## Moses had his clothes stolen by a stone

[Sahih al Bukhari 278](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:278)

> ...once Moses went out to take a bath and put his clothes over a stone and then that stone ran away with his clothes. Moses followed that stone saying, "My clothes, O stone! My clothes, O stone!...

## Unbelievers visiting a mosque will go to hell

[Quran 9:17,18](https://quran.com/9/17-18)

## Muslims living abroad goes to hell

> When the angels seize the souls of those who have wronged themselves — scolding them, “What was wrong with you?” they will reply, “We were oppressed in the land.” The angels will respond, “Was Allah’s earth not spacious enough for you to emigrate?” It is they who will have Hell as their home—what an evil destination!

When muslims who live outside of Islamic countries (i.e. them being **opressed in the land**) die, the angel of death will scold them for not living in an Islamic country (i.e. **Allah’s earth**), and send them to hell.

# Women

## It's ok for a man to beat his wife

[Quran 4:34](https://quran.com/4/34)

> Men stand caretakers of women since Allah has made some of them excel the others, and because they have spent of their wealth., So, the righteous women are obedient, guarding in absence with the protection given by Allah. As for women whose disobedience you fear, convince them, and leave them apart in beds, and **beat them**. Then, if they obey you, do not seek a way against them. Surely, Allah is the Highest, the Greatest.

This is if a man even only fears his wife would be disobedient.

## It's ok to marry and divorce girls who have not yet menstruated

[Surah 65:4](https://quran.com/65/4)

Context from [verse 1:](https://quran.com/65/1)

> O Prophet! ˹Instruct the believers:˺ **When you intend to˺ divorce women, then divorce them with concern for their waiting period**...

There's a waiting period a divorced woman has to wait before she can remarry.  

> As for your women past the age of menstruation, in case you do not know, their waiting period is three months, **and those who have not menstruated as well**. As for those who are pregnant, their waiting period ends with delivery. And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make their matters easy for them.

This means men are allowed to marry and divorce prepubescent girls.

## The majority of people in hell are women

[Sahih al Bukhari 304](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:304)

> Once Allah's Messenger  went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) of 'Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by the women and said, "O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women)." …

## Women are mentally deficient 

[Sahih al Bukhari 2658](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2658)

> The Prophet said, "Isn't the witness of a woman equal to half of that of a man?" The women said, "Yes." He said, "This is because of the deficiency of a woman's mind."
