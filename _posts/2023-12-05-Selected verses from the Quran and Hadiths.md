Some selected Quran and Hadith verses.

[TOC]

<small> Note that there are many translations of the Quran and few of them are honest. Most of them paraphrase, add, remove, and change words to make it seem more palpable to westerners. For example, surah 4:34 says that men can "strike" their wives, but the Clear Quran renders this "discipline them gently". Or surah 1:157 which says that "Allah prays" (salawatun, from salat, pray), they change it to "blesses". As the saying goes "without lies Islam dies". If you don't expect honesty from Islamic scholars you will usually be right. Therefore I will link to archived versions of the sites, because the administrators of sunnah.com and other Muslim websites are dishonest and change embarrasing translations.</small>

<small>Since the hadiths are often unnecessarily verbose, unnecessary text has been removed to cut down on the volume of text; The original Surahs and Hadiths are linked if you want to read the full text.</small>
