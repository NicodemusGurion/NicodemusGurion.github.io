Some selected Quran and Hadith verses.

[TOC]

# Allah

## Allah prays

[Al Adan Al Mufrad 645](https://sunnah.com/adab:645)

> Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If anyone prays once on me, Allah will pray ten times on him.'"

Who is Allah praying to?

## Allah is a narcissist 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4634](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4634)

> And none loves to be praised more than Allah does, and for this reason He praises Himself.

## Allah wonders

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3010](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3010)

> The Prophet said, "Allah wonders at those people who will enter Paradise in chains."

Apparently there are things that surprise Allah. How could someone supposedly all-knowing wonder about anything?

# Animals

## Owning a dog gives you minus points

[Sahih al Bukhari 5480](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5480)

> Narrated Ibn Umar: The Prophet said, "Whoever keeps a (pet) dog which is neither a watch dog nor a hunting dog, will get a daily deduction of two Qirat from his good deeds."

# Contradictions

[Quran 4:82](https://quran.com/4/82)

> Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Had it been from anyone other than Allah, they would have certainly found in it many inconsistencies.

If the Quran is from Allah, there should be no contradictions.

## How long did it take Allah to create the world?

Was it 6 days or 8 days?

[Quran 10:3](https://quran.com/10/3)

> Surely your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days,...

[Quran 41:9-12](https://quran.com/41?startingVerse=9)

Allah created the heavens and the earth in 6 days.

> Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “How can you disbelieve in the One Who created the earth in two Days? And how can you set up equals with Him? That is the Lord of all worlds. He placed on the earth firm mountains, standing high, showered His blessings upon it, and ordained ˹all˺ its means of sustenance—totaling four Days exactly1—for all who ask. ... So He formed the heaven into seven heavens in two Days, assigning to each its mandate. ... 

2 + 4 + 2 = 8. Allah created the heavens and the earth in 8 days.

# Factual errors 

Historical and factual errors 

## Jews think Ezra is the son of Allah

[Quran 9:30](https://quran.com/9/31)

> The Jews say, “Ezra is the son of Allah,” and the Christians say, “The Messiah is the son of Allah.” These are mere words that they utter, imitating the words of the disbelievers before them. May Allah ruin them; how can they be deluded?

No Jews have ever claimed that Ezra is the son of God. How deluded is Muhammad to believe in such nonsense?

# Food

## Muhammad didn't like garlic

[Sahih al Bukhari 5451](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5451)

> Narrated `Abdul `Aziz: It was said to Anas "What did you hear the Prophet  saying about garlic?" Anas replied, "Whoever has eaten (garlic) should not approach our mosque."

## Non-Muslims eats in seven intestines, Muslims in one

Apparently belief or disbelief in Islam changes the number of intestines you have.

[Sahih Muslim 2060 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2060a)

> Ibn 'Umar reported Allah's Messenger  as saying that a non-Muslim eats in seven intestines whereas a Muslim eats in one intestine.

# Health and Hygiene

How Muhammad viewed health and hygiene issues. (There's a lot of spit.)

## Muhammad told his followers to drink sewer water 

[Sunan Abu Dawud 67](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:67)

> Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri: I heard that the people asked the Prophet of Allah : Water is brought for you from the well of Buda'ah. It is a well in which dead dogs, menstrual clothes and excrement of people are thrown. The Messenger of Allah  replied: Verily water is pure and is not defiled by anything...

To say that water is not defiled by anything, not even the rotting corpses of dogs, menstrual waste products and literal feces is insane and unscientific. This unhygienic idea has probably cost the lives of untold numbers of people throughout history.

## Muhammad told his followers to lick each other's hands

[Sahih al Bukhari 5456](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5456)

> Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: The Prophet  said, 'When you eat, do not wipe your hands till you have licked it, or had it licked by somebody else."

## Muhammad spit three times in a man's wound

[Sahih al Bukhari 4206](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4206)

> I saw the trace of a wound in Salama's leg. I said to him, "O Abu Muslim! What is this wound?" He said, "This was inflicted on me on the day of Khaibar and the people said, 'Salama has been wounded.' Then I went to the Prophet  and he puffed his saliva in the wound thrice., and since then I have not had any pain in it till this hour."

## Muhammad believed spit mixed with dirt could cure illnesses 

[Sahih al Bukhari 5745](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5745)

> Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet  used to say to the patient, "In the Name of Allah The earth of our land and the saliva of some of us cure our patient."

- [Riyad as-Salihin 901](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:901)
- [Sunnan Ibn Majah 3521](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3521)

## Muhammad tried to heal himself by blowing raspberries 

[Mishkat al-Masabih 1532](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:1532)

> She said that when the Prophet had a complaint he would blow on himself, ejecting saliva, reciting the Mu'awwidhah, and wipe himself with his hand. She said, “When he suffered from the pain of which he died, I would blow on him ejecting saliva and recite the Mu'awwidhat as he did, and would take the Prophet’s hand to wipe him.”  

## Muhammad spit in the mouth of a newborn child

[Sahih al Bukhari 5469](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5469)

> I conceived 'Abdullah bin AzZubair at Mecca and went out (of Mecca) while I was about to give birth. I came to Medina and encamped at Quba', and gave birth at Quba'. Then I brought the child to Allah's Messenger  and placed it (on his lap). He asked for a date, chewed it, and put his saliva in the mouth of the child. So the first thing to enter its stomach was the saliva of Allah's Messenger

## Muhammad exhumed a dead man and spit in his mouth

[Sahih Muslim 2773a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2773a)

> Jabir reported Allah's Apostle  came to the grave of 'Abdullah b. Ubayy, brought him out from that, placed him on his knee and put his saliva in his mouth and shrouded him in his own shirt and Allah knows best.

## A wife of Muhammad used a dish to catch yellow menstrual discharge while praying

[Sahih al Bukhari 310](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:310)

> Narrated 'Aisha: "One of the wives of Allah's Messenger  joined him in I'tikaf and she noticed blood and yellowish discharge (from her private parts) and put a dish under her when she prayed."

## Muhammad would not provide more than one garment each to his wives

When they had menstrual blood stain their garments they would have to clean them with spit.

[Sahih al Bukhari 312](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:312)

> Narrated 'Aisha: None of us had more than a single garment and we used to have our menses while wearing it. Whenever it got soiled with blood of menses we used to apply saliva to the blood spot and rub off the blood with our nails.

## Muhammad's clothes were covered in semen stains

[Sahih al Bukhari 232](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:232)

> Narrated 'Aishah: I used to wash the semen off the clothes of the Prophet and even then I used to notice one or more spots on them.

# Jews

## The verse they use to lie that Islam is peaceful 

[Quran 5:32](https://quran.com/5/32)

> That is why We ordained **for the Children of Israel** that whoever takes a life—**unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land**—it will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity.1 ˹Although˺ Our messengers already came to them with clear proofs, many of them still transgressed afterwards through the land.

This verse is often quoted by Muslims doing Taqqiya to say that Islam is peaceful. But as you can see, it is a command directed to the people of Israel, not Muslims. 

It is a quotation from the Talmud. So the Quran is actually saying that the commentary by a rabbi in the Talmud is "revelation from Allah."

Also notice that this command has the stipulation "unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land", meaning that Jews had the right of capital punishment for those spreading mischief in the land. But in other cases, killing one would be like killing all. 

And what "land" is it talking about? Well, the land of the Jews, Israel, or Palestine as it was later renamed. 

*So according to the Quran, the Jews has the right to execute capital punishment on those spreading mischief in the land of Israel (Palestine).*

But wait, it gets better. The next verse is what applies to Muslims:

[Quran 5:33](https://quran.com/5/33)

> Indeed, the penalty **for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger** and spread mischief in the land is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land.** This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous **punishment in the Hereafter.**

This is directed to Muslims, how to deal with those who "who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land". The Muslims are to kill, crucify, dismember and exile people. And after they die, Allah sends them to hell."

# Mohammad

Things that Mohammad did.

## Mohammed married and had sex with a prepubescent child

Aisha, the favorite wife of Muhammad, was 6 years old when Muhammad married her, and he had sex with their when she was only 9 years old. She was prepubescent, still playing with dolls together with her playmates. Dolls are usually forbidden but we're allowed for Aisha since she was a "little girl" so young that normal Islamic rules didn't yet apply to her.

[Sunna an Nasa'i 3378](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3378)

> "The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls."

[Sahih al Bukhari 6130](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130)

> Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger  used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was **a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.**) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)

## Muhammed used to put his face into Aishas crotch and recite Quran verses when she was menstruating

[Sunan Ibn Majah 634](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:634)

> It was narrated that 'Aishah said: "The Messenger of Allah used to put his head in my lap when I was menstruating and recite Qur'an."

## Muhammad used to fondle Aisha when she was menstruating

[Sahih al Bukhari 299](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:299)

> Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet  and I used to take a bath from a single pot while we were Junub. During the menses, he used to order me to put on an Izar (dress worn below the waist) and used to fondle me. While in I'tikaf, he used to bring his head near me and I would wash it while I used to be in my periods (menses).

## How did Muhammad die?

### Allah promises to cut off his aorta if he tells a lie

[Quran 69:44-47](https://quran.com/69?startingVerse=44)

 >Had the Messenger made up something in Our Name, We would have certainly seized him by his right hand, then severed his aorta, and none of you could have shielded him ˹from Us˺!

[Musnad Ahmad 107](https://sunnah.com/ahmad:107)

> And if he (Muhammad ﷺ) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah). We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), And then **We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta)**, And none of you could have withheld Us from (punishing) him...”

So Allah promises that Muhammed ever acts as a false prophet, Allah will cut off his aorta.

### Muhammad eats a poisoned lamb

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 4512](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4512)

> Narrated Abu Hurairah: ...So a Jewess presented him at Khaybar with a roasted sheep which she had poisoned. The Messenger of Allah  ate of it and the people also ate. He then said: Take away your hands (from the food), for it has informed me that it is poisoned. Bishr ibn al-Bara' ibn Ma'rur al-Ansari died. So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess (and said to her): What motivated you to do the work you have done? She said: If you were a prophet, it would not harm you; but if you were a king, I should rid the people of you. The Messenger of Allah  then ordered regarding her and she was killed. He then said about the pain of which he died: I continued to feel pain from the morsel which I had eaten at Khaybar. This is the time when **it has cut off my aorta.**

- [Sahih al Bukhari 2617](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2617)
- [Sahih al Bukhari 3169](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3169)
- [Sahih al Bukhari 4249](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4249)
- [Sahih al Bukhari 5777](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5777)
- [Sunnah Abu Dawud 4508](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4508)
- [Sunnah Abu Dawud 4510](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4510)

After Muhammad kills the whole male Jewish population of Khaibar, a Jewish woman offers him roasted lamb. Being arguably the dumbest person in history, Muhammad accepts it. And it turns out that it was poisoned. Some of his men died, but Muhammad was affected for a long time from the lingering poison. Notice that Muhammad is saying that the pain from the poison feels like it is cutting off his aorta.

### Muhammad dies

[Sahih al Bukhari 4428](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4428)
  
> Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet  in his ailment in which he died, used to say, "O `Aisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, **I feel as if my aorta is being cut** from that poison."

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 4513](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4513)

> ...I do not think about the illness of my son except the poisoned sheep of which he had eaten with you at Khaybar. The Prophet  said: And I do not think about my illness except that. **This is the time when it cut off my aorta**...

Muhammad eventually died from the poisoned lamb of a jewish woman, and he did so while complaining that he felt as if his aorta was being cut. This is exactly how Allah said he would die if he was a false prophet.

Notice also the poetic biblical references in that a false anti-christ prophet was killed by Allah after eating of the Lamb that came from a Jewish woman.

## What was the last words of Muhammad?

While Jesus used his last moments to forgive his enemies, Muhammad used his last moments to curse one third of the world population.

[Sahih Muslim 531](https://sunnah.com/muslim:531)

>  'A'isha and Abdullah reported: As the Messenger of Allah  was about to breathe his last, he drew his sheet upon his face and when he felt uneasy, he uncovered his face and said in that very state: Let there be curse upon the Jews and the Christians that they have taken the graves of their apostles as places of worship. He in fact warned (his men) against what they (the Jews and the Christians) did.

## What was the last action of Muhammad?

Sharing a toothbrush with two other people.

[Sahih al Bukhari 4450](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4450)

> Aisha added, "The Prophet  expired on the day of my turn in my house and he was taken unto Allah while his head was against my chest and his saliva mixed with my saliva." 'Aisha added, "Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr came in, carrying a Siwak he was cleaning his teeth with. Allah's Messenger  looked at it and I said to him, 'O 'AbdurRahman! Give me this Siwak.' So he gave it to me and I cut it, chewed it (it's end) and gave it to Allah's Messenger  who cleaned his teeth with it while he was resting against my chest."

- [Sahih al Bukhari 4451](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4451)
- [Sahih al Bukhari 5217](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5217)

## Muhammad didn't leave an inheritance for his wives and daughters 

Instead they had to go to Abu Bakr to get what they needed to survive as a charity.

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 2969](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2969)

> Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin: Fatimah was demanding (the property of) sadaqah of the Messenger of Allah  at Medina and Fadak, and what remained from the fifth of Khaybar. Aisha quoted AbuBakr as saying: The Messenger of Allah  said: We are not inherited; whatever we leave is sadaqah (charity). The family of Muhammad will eat from this property, that is, from the property of Allah. They will not take more then their sustenance.

Muhammad's daughter Fatima was denied her inheritance.

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 2976](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2976)

> Narrated 'Aishah: When the Messenger of Allah  died, the wives of the Prophet  intended to send 'Uthman b. 'Affan to Abu Bakr to ask him their cost of living from (the inheritance of) the Prophet . Thereupon 'Aishah said: Did not the Messenger of Allah  say: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah.

The wives of Muhammad were also denied an inheritance.

## The parents of Muhammad are in hell

[Sahih Muslim 976b](https://sunnah.com/muslim/11/135)

> Abu Huraira reported: The Apostle of Allah  visited the grave of his mother and he wept, and moved others around him to tears, and said: **I sought permission from my Lord to beg forgiveness for her but it was not granted to me**, and I sought permission to visit her grave and it was granted to me so visit the graves, for that makes you mindful of death.

Muhammad was not allowed to ask forgiveness for his mother, meaning Allah will not forgive her, meaning she is in hell.

[Sunan Abu Dawud 4718](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4718)

> Anas said : A man asked : where is my father, Messenger of Allah? He replied! Your father is in Hell. When he turned his back, he said : **My father and your father are in Hell.**

Muhammad's father is in hell.

## Muhammad was the first Muslim

[Quran 6:14](https://quran.com/6/14)

> Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Will I take any guardian other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who provides for all and is not in need of provision?” Say, “I have been commanded to be the first to submit and not be one of the polytheists.”

## Allah considered Muhammad the perfect example

[Quran 33:21](https://quran.com/33/21)

> Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for whoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah often.

[Quran 68:4](https://quran.com/68/4)

> And you are truly a man of outstanding character.

# Satan

## Satan urinates in your ear

[Sahih al Bukhari 1144](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1144)

> Narrated 'Abdullah: A person was mentioned before the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and he was told that he had kept on sleeping till morning and had not got up for the prayer. The Prophet said, "Satan urinated in his ears."

## Satan farts to not hear the call to prayer 

[Sahih Muslim 389a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:389a)

> When Satan hears the call to prayer, he turns back and breaks the wind so as not to hear the call being made...

## Yawning is from Satan

[Sahih al Bukhari 3289](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3289)

> Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, "Yawning is from Satan and if anyone of you yawns, he should check his yawning as much as possible, for if anyone of you (during the act of yawning) should say: 'Ha', Satan will laugh at him."

## Satan likes bells

[Sahih Muslim 2114](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2114)

> The bell is the musical instrument of the Satan.

## Muhammad once defeated Satan in a wrestling match

[Sahih al Bukhari 1210](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1210)

> Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, "Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. Then I remembered the statement of Prophet Solomon, 'My Lord ! Bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.' Then Allah made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated)."

# Science

## What determines if a child looks like its mother or father?

[Sahih al Bukhari 3329](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3329)

> If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife and gets discharge first, the child will resemble the father, and if the woman gets discharge first, the child will resemble her.


# Spiritual and mental health 

## Muhammad was susceptible to magic

[Sahih Al Bukhari 3268](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3268)

> Magic was worked on the Prophet  so that he began to fancy that he was doing a thing which he was not actually doing. One day he invoked (Allah) for a long period and then said, "I feel that Allah has inspired me as how to cure myself. Two persons came to me (in my dream) and sat, one by my head and the other by my feet. One of them asked the other, "What is the ailment of this man?" The other replied, 'He has been bewitched"...

[Sahih Al Bukhari 5765 provides more detail:](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5765)

> Magic was worked on Allah's Messenger  so that he used to think that he had sexual relations with his wives while he actually had not...

- [Sahih al Bukhari 6391](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6391)

## Muhammad was suicidal and wanted to jump of a mountain

[Sahih al Bukhari 91](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/91)

> …the Prophet  became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear before him and say, "O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah's Messenger  in truth" whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he had said before.

# Paradise

## All fruit looks the same in paradise

[Quran 2:25](https://quran.com/2/25)

> And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens under which rivers flow. Every time they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” for they will be given fruit that resemble one another. They will have purified spouses, and they will abide therein forever.

## There are 7 heavens

[Quran 2:29](https://quran.com/2/29)

> It is He Who created for you all that is in the earth, then He turned towards the heaven and made them seven heavens, and He is All-Knowing of every thing.

# The Quran

## How to know if the Quran is inspired

[Quran 2:23](https://quran.com/2/23)[, 24](https://quran.com/2/24)

> 23 If you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down upon Our slave, then produce a chapter like it and call upon your helpers other than Allah, if you are truthful.24 But if you did not do it, and you can never do it; then beware of the Fire whose fuel will be people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers.

The only claim to inspiration the Quran makes is in its literary excellence, claiming no one can produce a chapter like it. But if you have read it the first thing that strikes you is how vacuous, uninspired, boring, confused, and contradictory it is. Even a mediocre poet would be able to write a chapter far more excellent than most chapters of the Quran.

## The Quran is not perfectly preserved

### Allah foretold that the Quran wouldn’t be perfectly preserved 

[Quran 2:106](https://quran.com/2/106)

> If We ever abrogate a verse or **cause it to be forgotten**, We replace it with a better or similar one. Do you not know that Allah is Most Capable of everything?

### Two chapters of the Quran were eaten by a sheep

[Sunan Ibn Majah 1944](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1944)

> It was narrated that 'Aishah said “The Verse of stoning and of breastfeeding an adult ten times was revealed, and the paper was with me under my pillow. When the Messenger of Allah died, we were preoccupied with his death, and a tame sheep came in and ate it.”

## Chapters of the Quran could be ordered on demand

[Sahih al Bukhari 4483](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4483)

> I also said, 'O Allah's Messenger ! Good and bad persons visit you! Would that you ordered the Mothers of the believers to cover themselves with veils.' So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were revealed. 


# Weird or miscellaneous 

## "The eyes are the leather strap of the anus"

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 203](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:203)

> The Messenger of Allah  said: The eyes are the leather strap of the anus, so one who sleeps should perform ablution.

> ...once Moses went out to take a bath and put his clothes over a stone and then that stone ran away with his clothes. Moses followed that stone saying, "My clothes, O stone! My clothes, O stone!...


# Women

## It's ok for a man to beat his wife

> Men stand caretakers of women since Allah has made some of them excel the others, and because they have spent of their wealth., So, the righteous women are obedient, guarding in absence with the protection given by Allah. As for women whose disobedience you fear, convince them, and leave them apart in beds, and **beat them**. Then, if they obey you, do not seek a way against them. Surely, Allah is the Highest, the Greatest.

This is if a man even only fears his wife would be disobedient.

## It's ok to marry and divorce girls who have not yet menstruated

[Surah 65:4](https://quran.com/65/4)

Context, verse 1:

> O Prophet! ˹Instruct the believers:˺ **When you intend to˺ divorce women, then divorce them with concern for their waiting period**...

There's a waiting period before a man can divorce a wife.

> As for your women past the age of menstruation, in case you do not know, their waiting period is three months, **and those who have not menstruated as well**. As for those who are pregnant, their waiting period ends with delivery.1 And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make their matters easy for them.

So men are allowed to marry and divorce prepubescent girls, as long as they respect the waiting period for divorce.

He replied, "You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you." The women asked, "O Allah's Messenger ! What is deficient in our intelligence and religion?" He said, "Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?" They replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?" The women replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her religion."
