<p id="p20">Some European capitals are even taking a position against the Common Market Commission. A German observer noted: “Confidence has dropped to a new low. Disappointment and resignation are spreading. ‘The Six’ have virtually ceased to move ahead.” In fact, Common Market employees in Brussels have left by the hundreds to seek more promising careers elsewhere.</p>

These efforts at European unification simply provide another example of man’s inability to provide the peace that is so much desired by mankind. For lasting peace, men must look to God.</p>
