Some claim the gospels were written a very late, some say several hundred years after the events happened. The consensus of new testament scholarship is that the gospels were written roughly between the year 70 to 100 AD. Most say Mark was written around 70 AD, Matthew and Luke/Acts around the 80AD mark, and John roughly somewhere in the 90's. However internal evidence shows that the gospels were in fact written much earlier than this.
<h2>Why is early dating important?</h2>Early dating of the gospels is important because of trustworthiness. If youâ€™re going to tell a lie, you should tell it at a time and in a place where no one who knows the truth will be around to challenge you. If the gospels are written after most eyewitnesses have died it could case doubts to their trustworthiness. But if the gospels were written down within the lifespan of the eyewitnesses their trustworthiness is much higher.

Could the authors still be lying? Yes, it's not impossible, but at least they would be lying in the time period and area where the actual events. In which case there would be a lot of people arround who would call them out on it.
<h2>Why do scholars give such late dates?</h2>There are two major reasons why scholars assign such late dates for the gospels:
<ol>
 	<li>They assume that since the Gospel of Mark is the shortest one it is also the first one written.</li>
 	<li>Since Mark chapter 13 has a rather vivid description of the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 70 AD they conclude that it could not have been written before 70 AD.</li>
</ol>Hence they put mark around 70 AD and all the other gospels after that.

There are some big problems with this line of reasoning however. First of all it is a logical fallacy to assume that since a book is smaller that it was written earlier. It's a non-sequitur. The conclusion does not follow from the premise. Why would the size of a book have anything to do with when it is authored? If you use the same logic with the other Bible books then you could argue Jude was the first and Psalms the last Bible book to be written.

And the premise that Mark was written first also
