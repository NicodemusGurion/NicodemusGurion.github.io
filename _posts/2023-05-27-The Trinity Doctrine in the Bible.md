The Trinity Doctrine is probably the most misunderstood and attacked Christian doctrine. It is firmly rooted in the Bible. Here is a list of scriptures that prove or support the trinity doctrine along with explanations. This list will be continually expanded.

# The Trinity: Definitions and common misunderstanding

The Christian doctrine of the Trinity is the central doctrine concerning the nature of God, which defines one God existing in three coequal[^coequal], coeternal[^coeternal], consubstantial[^cosubstantial] divine persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ) and God the Holy Spirit, three distinct persons (hypostases) sharing one being/essence/substance/nature (homoousion). In this context, one being/essence/substance/nature defines **what** God is, while the three persons define **who** God is. Since *what* someone is and *who* someone is are two distinct concepts there is no contradiction in the idea that God is one being with three persons.

[^coequal]: Being equal in essence. No one is more of less "God", however in the cooperation between the persons of God, there is a certain hierarchy of authority and responsibility.
[^coeternal]: All if the are eternal. None has a beginning nor an end. 
[^cosubstantial]: Consisting of the same substance or essence. Substance is whatever makes a being what it is. For example the human substance is what makes a person human.

## Titles and attributes of God

Notice that in the Bible there are several titles and attributes that identify Jehovah God. Whenever someone is said to posess these, it is an indication that the writer and readers understands that it's talking about God. Some of these attributes are given to God in the old testament and to Jesus Christ in the New Testament, showing that the weiter and readers considered them to be one and the same. These include 
- [The Son of Man](#the-son-of-man)
- [The one who comes on the clouds](#the-cloud-rider)
- [The one to whom every knee will bow](#the-one-to-whom-every-knee-will-bow) 
- [The one with the highest name](#the-one-with-the-highest-name)
- [The First and the Last](#the-first-and-the-last)

These help us understand and identify God in scripture, and are exlained before the footnotes.


## Common misunderstandings

- The trinity doctrine doesn't teach three gods or a triad if gods. That is called tritheism.
- The trinity doctrine doesn't teach that there are three persons in one person. That makes no sense.
- The trinity doctrine doesnt teach that one person manifest in three different modes, facets or aspects. That's modalism.
- The trinity doctrine does not teach that God consists of three parts that together form one God. That's partialism.

# The Trinity in scripture

Here is a list of scriptures that harmonize with or prove the trinity doctrine, along with explanations as to what part of the doctrine they touch on.

## Exodus 19:9 

> And Jehovah said to Moses, “Behold, **I am coming to you in a thick cloud**, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.” When Moses told the words of the people to Jehovah,

[See The Cloud Rider](#the-cloud-rider)

## Deuteronomy 33:26 

> “There is none like God, O Jeshurun, **who rides through the heavens** to your help, through the skies in his majesty.

[See The Cloud Rider](#the-cloud-rider)


## Nehemiah 9:5 

> Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, “Stand up and bless the LORD your God from everlasting to everlasting. **Blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise**.

Jehovah has the highest name. [Philippians 2:9](#philippians-29) reveal that Jesus is the one with the highest name. So either Jesus is Jehovah or Jehovah is not the highest name.

## Job 9:8 

> who **alone** stretched out the heavens and **trampled the waves of the sea;**

The ability to walk on water is a unique attribute of God. In [Matthew 14:25](#matthew-1425), [Mark 6:48](#mark-648) and [John 6:19](#john-619) Jesus is the one who walks on water, so the disciples immediately realize that Jesus is Jehovah.

## Psalms 68:32-33 

> O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God; sing praises to the Lord, 33 to **him who rides in the heavens**, the ancient heavens; behold, he sends out his voice, his mighty voice.

[See The Cloud Rider](#the-cloud-rider)

## Psalm 83:18 

> that they may know that you alone, whose name is Jehovah, are the Most High over all the earth. 

This scripture tellsnus that Jehovah God is the highest over all the earth. [Philippians 2:10-11](#philippians-210-11) shows that Jesus is the one who is the most high over all the earth.

## Psalm 102:25-27 

> Of old you [Jehovah] laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. 26 They will perish, but you will remain; they will all wear out like a garment. You will change them like a robe, and they will pass away, 27 but you are the same, and your years have no end.

Paul takes this scripture about Jehovah and applies it to Jesus in [Hebrews 1:10-12](#hebrews-110-12), because Paul believed that Jesus is the Jehovah of the Old Testament.

## Psalms 104:3 

He lays the beams of his chambers on the waters; **he makes the clouds his chariot; he rides on the wings of the wind**;

[See The Cloud Rider](#the-cloud-rider)

## Psalm 130:4 

> But with you there is forgiveness, that you may be feared.

There is forgiveness only in God. He is the only one with the absolute right to forgive, even sins not committed against him. But in [Mark 2:5-12](#mark-25-12) Jesus forgives the sins of a man, and the scribes understood that this is something only God can do, thinking that Jesus was blaspheming. Jesus wasn't blaspheming because Jesus is God, the second person.


## Psalm 138:2

> I bow down toward your holy temple and give thanks to your name for your steadfast love and your faithfulness, for **you have exalted above all things your name and your word**.

God's name and word is exalted above all things. [Philippians 2:9](#philippians-29) shows that Jesus is then one with the uniquely highest name. Also Jesus is the Word of God. This means Jesus is divine. 

## Psalm 148:13 

> Let them praise the name of Jehovah, for his name alone is exalted; his majesty is above earth and heaven.

Jehovah uniquely has the highest name.  [Philippians 2:9](#philippians-29) shows that Jesus is the one with the uniquely highest name. This means Jesus is divine. 

## Isaiah 19:1 

> An oracle concerning Egypt. Behold, **Jehovah is riding on a swift cloud** and comes to Egypt; and the idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence, and the heart of the Egyptians will melt within them.

[See The Cloud Rider](#the-cloud-rider)

## Isaiah 42:8 

> I am Jehovah; that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to carved idols.

Jehovah God gives his glory to no other. Yet in scriptures like [John 5:23](#john-523), [Matthew 16:27](#matthew-1627), and [2 Peter 1:17](#2-peter-117), The Son, Jesus, is glorified by the Father and humans with equal glory to the Father. Since Jehovah gives his glory to no other, it means that Jesus is no other than Jehovah. This proves the deity of Christ.

## Isaiah 43:25 

> “I, I am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and I will not remember your sins.

God is the one who blots out transgressions, and no one else. He is the only one with the absolute right to forgive, even sins not committed against him. But in [Mark 2:5-12](#mark-25-12) Jesus forgives the sins of a man, and the scribes understood that this is something only God can do, thinking that Jesus was blaspheming. Jesus wasn't blaspheming because Jesus is God, the second person.

## Isaiah 44:6 

> Thus says the LORD [Jehovah], the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: “I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god.

**The king of Israel** and the **redeemer** is Jesus.

**[The First and the Last](#the-first-and-the-last)** is a unique title of God which emphasizes his eternity. In [Revelation 1:17](#revelation-117);[2:23](#revelation-223) Jesus calls himself by this title, thus claiming that he is the eternal God.

## Isaiah 45:23 

> By myself I have sworn; from my mouth has gone out in righteousness a word that shall not return: ‘**To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear allegiance**.’

Every knee shall bow before Jehovah, and every tongue swear allegiance. In [Philippians 2:10-11](#philippians-210-11) these phrases are used to describe Jesus. So Paul is asceibing equality between Jesus and Jehovah God. This indicates the Deity of Christ.

## Isaiah 48:11 

> For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it, for how should my name be profaned? My glory I will not give to another.

Jehovah God gives his glory to no other. Yet in scriptures like [John 5:23](#john-523), [Matthew 16:27](#matthew-1627), and [2 Peter 1:17](#2-peter-117), The Son, Jesus, is glorified by the Father and humans with equal glory to the Father. Since Jehovah gives his glory to no other, it means that Jesus is no other than Jehovah. This proves the deity of Christ.

## Jeremiah 23:23-24  

> “Am I a God at hand, declares the LORD, and not a God far away? 24 Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? declares the LORD. Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the LORD.”

God is omnipresent, filling heaven and earth, is near and far, and in every secret place. Both God the Father, The Son and the Holy Spirit are said to be omnipresent. See [Omnipresence](#omnipresence)

## Daniel 7:13 

> “I saw in the night visions, and behold, **with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man**, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him.

Daniel 7:13 links together the Cloud Rider of the Old Testament with the Cloud Rider of the new testament and shows that Jesus is Jehovah. [See The Cloud Rider](#the-cloud-rider)

## Daniel 9:9 

> To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him

Forgiveness belongs to God alone. He is the only one with the absolute right to forgive, even sins not committed against him. But in [Mark 2:5-12](#mark-25-12) Jesus forgives the sins of a man, and the scribes understood that this is something only God can do, thinking that Jesus was blaspheming. Jesus wasn't blaspheming because Jesus is God, the second person.


## Matthew 1:23 

> “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel” (which means, **God with us**).

Jesus wasn't literally named Immanuel. Matthew means that this name applies to Jesus because Jesus is "God with us".

## Matthew 9:4 

> But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts?

Jesus is **knowing their thoughts** because he is omniscient, having the ability to know anything and everything. This is an attribute of God. See [Omniscience](#omniscience)

## Matthew 14:25 

> And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, **walking on the sea**.

The disciples knew that only God has the power to walk on the water. ([Job 9:8](#job-98)) This shows that Jesus is God, and why they fell down and worshipped him. ([Matthew 14:33](#matthew-1433))

## Matthew 14:33

> And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”
 
They **worshipped him** because [in verse 25](#matthew-1425) they had just seen him do something that a Jew knew only Jehovah does, walking on water. See [Job 9:8](#job-98) for the scriptural basis for this.

They recognized that Jesus is **the Son of God**. Not "a" son of God as someone from the [Divine Council](#the-divine-council) may be referred to, but "the", as in [the unique son of God](#monogenes). Unique in the sense that he partakes of the same substance as the Father. See [The Son of God](#monogenes).

## Matthew 16:27 

> For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay each person according to what he has done.

Jesus is here called **the [Son of Man](#son-of-man)**, which is a divine title for the human manifestation of Jehovah mentioned in [Daniel 7:13](#daniel-713)

See [Son of Man](#the-son-of-man).

Jesus is coming **in the glory of his Father**. Scriptures like [Isaiah 42:8](#isaiah-428) and [48:11](#isaiah-4811) show that God does not allow anyone else to have equal glory to him. This means that Jesus is no one else but God. This proves the deity of Christ.

That Jesus will **repay each person according to what he has done**. [Isaiah 40:10](#isaiah-4010) shows that the one who does this is Jehovah, meaning Jesus is Jehovah. [Romans 2:6](#romans-26) shows that the one who does this is God, meaning Jesus is God. It also shows that the one mentioned in [Revelation 22:12](#revelation-2212) is Jesus, who is the Alpha and Omega, who is God Almighty. This is proof of the deity of Christ.

See [The one who repays deeds](#the-one-who-repays-deeds)


## Matthew 18:20  

> For where two or three are gathered in my name, **there am I among them**.” 

This shows that Jesus is omnipresent, having the ability to be anywhere. This is a unique attribute of God, evidence of the deity of Christ. See [Omnipresence](#omnipresence)

## Matthew 24:30 
> Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and **they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven** with power and great glory.

Jesus is [The Cloud Rider](#the-cloud-rider), a unique attribute of God.

## Matthew 28:20 

> teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, **I am with you always**, to the end of the age.”

This shows that Jesus is omnipresent, having the ability to be anywhere. This is a unique attribute of God, evidence of the deity of Christ. See [Omnipresence](#omnipresence)

## Mark 2:5-12 

> And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.” 6 Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, 7 “Why does this man speak like that? **He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?**” 8 And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, “Why do you question these things in your hearts? 9 Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise, take up your bed and walk’? 10 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”--he said to the paralytic-- 11 “I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.” 12 And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”

When the scribes get upset and accuse Jesus of blasphemy because Jesus forgives sins. This is something only God can do. See [Daniel 9:9](#daniel-99), [Psalm 130:4](#psalm-1304) and [Isaiah 43:25](#isaiah-4325) for example. This proves the deity of Jesus.


## Mark 6:48 

> And he saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, **walking on the sea**. He meant to pass by them,

The disciples knew that only God has the power to walk on the water. ([Job 9:8](#job-98)) This shows that Jesus is God, and why they fell downand worshipped him. ([Matthew 14:33](#matthew-1433))

## Mark 13:26 

> And then they will see the Son of Man **coming in clouds** with great power and glory.

Jesus is [The Cloud Rider](#the-cloud-rider), a unique attribute of God.

## Mark 14:62-64 

And Jesus said, “I am, and you will see **the Son of Man** seated at the right hand of Power, and **coming with the clouds of heaven**.” 63 And the high priest tore his garments and said, “What further witnesses do we need? 64 **You have heard his blasphemy**. What is your decision?” And **they all condemned him as deserving death.**

When putnunder oath, Jesus reveals that he is [The Cloud Rider](#the-cloud-rider) and [the Son of Man](#the-son-of-man), two divine titles that are unique to Jehovah God. Thus claiming to be God he was judged as a blasphemer.

## Luke 21:27 

> And then they will see the Son of Man **coming in a cloud** with power and great glory.

Jesus is [The Cloud Rider](#the-cloud-rider), a unique attribute of God.


## John 1:1 

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

This verse describes the second person of the trinity, known as the Son, Jesus or the Word. It shows that **in the beginning**, he already existed, meaning he is eternal. 

It also shows that he is a separate person from God, he was **with God**, but that at the same time he **was God**. 

The original greek grammar is hard to convey here. Greek sometimes use nouns as qualitative, describing a quality of something. So the Word being God means that the Word posesses all that qualities required for a person to be God. In short, he shares the divine substance.

## John 1:3 

> All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.

The Word, Jesus, is the creator of the universe. **All things were made through him**. As the second person of God he has been tasked with God's interaction with the physical world since the beginning, even creating the universe itself. is there anything that has been created that Jesus did not create? No, for it continues to emphasize **without him was not any thing made that was made.** This logically means that the Word, the second person of God, is not himself a created being, but an eternal, uncreated being without a beginning in time.

## John 1:18 

> No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father’s side, he has made him known.

Here it emphasizes that God is both invisible and visible. God the Father is invisible, but God the Son was made manifest visibly and made God known perfectly. 

## John 5:18  

> This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, **making himself equal with God.**

What Jesus said was no mistake but deliberately meant to make people believe he is equal in substance with God, in other words that he is God.

# John 5:23 

> that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.

That **all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father** means that Jesus is given equal honor or glory as the Father by men. In fact if someone does not give divine glory to the Son they do not give such to the Father. They are treated as being perfectly equal in glory.  Scriptures like [Isaiah 42:8](#isaiah-428) and [48:11](#isaiah-4811) show that God does not allow anyone else to have equal glory to him. This means that Jesus is no one else but God. This proves the deity of Christ.

## John 6:19 

> When they had rowed about three or four miles, **they saw Jesus walking on the sea** and coming near the boat, and they were frightened.

The disciples knew that only God has the power to walk on the water. ([Job 9:8](#job-98)) This shows that Jesus is God, and why they fell downand worshipped him. ([Matthew 14:33](#matthew-1433))

## John 10:30-33 

> **I and the Father are one.**” 31 The Jews picked up stones again to stone him. 32 Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?” 33 The Jews answered him, “It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because **you**, being a man, **make yourself God.**”

Jesus is one with God the Father in substance. The Jews are upset, they think Jesus is blaspheming because he is calling himself God.

## John 14:14 

> (ESV/NASB20/CSB) “If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.

In John 14:14 the greek text contains a "me" that some translations leave out. The greek says "ἐάν τι αἰτήσητέ **με** ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί μου ἐγὼ ποιήσω". This means Jesus commands us tonpray to him in his name. Jesus receives prayer because he is [omniscient](#omniscience), and since he is [omnipotent](#omnipotence) he can also do whatever is asked. This is something only God can do, which proves that Jesus is the second person of God.

## John 20:27-29 

> Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe.” 28 Thomas answered him, “**My Lord and my God!”** 29 Jesus said to him, “**Have you believed because you have seen me?** Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”

What a perfect time for Jesus to correct Thomas if Thomas was wrong in calling him God. But Jesus didn't correct him. Instead he asked "have you believed because you have seen me?" He was relieved that Thomas finally believed that Jesus is God.

## Acts 1:9 

> And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and **a cloud took him out of their sight.**

[See The Cloud Rider](#the-cloud-rider)

## Acts 9:14 

> And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.”

The phrase "calling on the name of" is an idiom that in the Bible is only used to describe the worship of a deity. The earliest Christians were immediately known far and wide as those who call on the name of Jesus, in other words those who worshipped Jesus. This shows that the earliest Christians regarded Jesus as divine.

See [Calling on the name of...](#calling-on-the-name-of)

## Acts 9:21 

> And all who heard him were amazed and said, “Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name? And has he not come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests?”

The Christians were known far and wide as **those who called upon this name**, that is, the name of Jesus. Calling upon the name of someone means to worship them as a deity. This proves the early Christians worshipped Jesus as God.

See [Calling on the name of...](#calling-on-the-name-of)

## Acts 20:28 

> Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood.

It is **the Holy Spirit** that **has made you overseers**. This shows that the Holy Spirit is a person with authority and agency, who makes decisions and carries out plans.

Jesus bought the flock **with his own blood**. Paul says it was the blood of God because he believed that Jesus is God. Thanks to Jesus taking on a human substance, it allowed God to bleed and to obtain us with his blood.

## Acts 22:16 

> And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.’

Among the first things Ananias instructs Paul to do is to pray to and worship Jesus by **calling on his name**.

See [Calling on the name of...](#calling-on-the-name-of)

## Romans 2:6

> He will render to each one according to his works:

God is the one who [The one who repays deeds](#the-one-who-repays-deeds). However this description is also used about Jesus in [Matthew 16:27](#matthew-1627) and [Revelation 22:12,13](#revelation-221213), proving the deity of Christ.

## Romans 14:11 

> for it is written, “As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.”

Paul is referring to [Isaiah 45:23](#isaiah-4523) which says that **every knee will bow to** God and **every tongue confess** him as Lord, and he is applying this to Jesus because Paul believed that Jesus is God. This indicates the deity of Christ


## 1 Corinthians 1:2 

> To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:

The earliest Christians were well known everywhere as **all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ**, in other words, those who prayed to and worshipped Jesus Christ.

See [Calling on the name of...](#calling-on-the-name-of)

## 2 Corinthians 12:8-9 

>Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. 9 But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.

Paul had a "thorn in the flesh", some sort of physical ailment. So he prayed about it. Who is **the Lord** Paul prayed to? **The Lord** told him "**my power is made perfect in weakness**". The power of **the Lord** helped Paul cope. Paul says that this power was **the power of Christ**. Hence Jesus Christ is the Lord that Paul prayed to three times about his thorn.

This proves that Jesus accepts prayer and that he is [omniscient](#omniscience), two attributes only God has.

## Philippians 2:5-7 

> Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, 6 who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, 7 but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.

Jesus has the form of God, being fully of the same substance as God the Father. He did not have the same status position as the Father and didn't grasp for that, but he emptied himself of the status that he did have to take on the lowliest status, that of a slave. He did this by taking on the substance of a human along with his divine substance, and to live a life of service.


## Philippians 2:9 

> Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,

In the Old Testament, Jehovah God has the highest name, the name above wvery name. But in the New Testament it is Jesus. So either Jehovah is not tye highest name anymore, or Jesus is the same as Jehovah. This indicates the deity of Christ.


## Philippians 2:10-11 

> so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

**Every knee should bow** shows that Jesus is receiving worship as God. Paul quotes Old Testament scriptures like [Isaiah 45:23](#isaiah-4523) which use these phrases for God. Paul is therefore ascribing equality between Jesus and Jehovah God. This proves the deity of Christ.

## Colossians 1:15 

> He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.

Jesus is the image of the invisible God. God the Father, the invisible God, still needs a way to interact with humans. So Jesus is the image, or physical, visible manifestation of the invisible God. Fully God, but in his humanity the visible representation that we humans can understand.

## Colossians 1:16 

> For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities -- all things were created through him and for him.

Jesus, the second person of God, **created all things** without exception. He is not himself created but eternally uncreated. To emphasize this, Paul lists "in heaven and on earth" which isnidiomatic for "everything, **visible and invisible** not leaving out the spirit world. **Thrones, doninions, rulers, authorities** are ranks of spirit beings, so Jesus is the origin of their existence and authority too. God created everything **through him and for him**. The second person being the active agent of creation and also the main reason for the universe to exist. The universe was created **by** him, **through** him, and **for** him. He is the instigator, the means and the end.

Jesus is therefore eternal and fully divine.

## Colossians 2:9  

> For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily,

In Jesus, **the whole fullness of deity dwells**. **The fullness of deity** means "everything that makes God God". So in Jesus dwells everything that makes God God. Whoever has everything that makes God God, is by definition God. Jesus is fully God. And the fullness if deity dwell bodily because Jesus took on a human substance.

## Titus 2:13 

> waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ

Jesus is called **our Great God and Savior** by the apostle Paul. This is what the first Christians believed.

## Hebrews 1:3 

> He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,

Jesus is the **Radiance of the Glory**. Glory is not Glory without it's radiance. The radiance is the Glory itself. God is not God without Jesus, Jesus is God. The earliest church Fathers compared the Father and Son to the Sun and the Sunshine. They would call both "sun". Today we may make a distinction, but in common parlance we still refer to both with the word "sun". "Let's move to the sun" means to go to where the sun shines, not to fly to the heavenly body called the sun. And if not for the sunshine we would not be able to know that the heavenly body existed. And like the sunshine is dependent on the heavenly body for their existence, so the Son is dependent on the Father for his existence. However not in the temporal way as if he ever had a beginning. God has always existed and the Son, the Glory of God has always radiated.

Jesus is **the exact imprint of God's nature**. Whatever God is, Jesus is. In the vein of [Colossians 1:15](#colossians-115) this explains that Jesus is God manifested in a way humans can understand.  

Jesus **upholds the universe** by his power, showing he is almighty, omnipotent. Every atom is in place thanks to him.

That **he sat down at the right hand** of God the Father shows that the Son is still separate from the Father.

## Hebrews 1:8  

> But **of the Son he says, “Your throne, O God**, is forever and ever, the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.

God the Father calls Jesus "God". 

## Hebrews 1:10-12 

> But **of the Son** he says,... 10 And, “You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of your hands; 11 they will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment, 12 like a robe you will roll them up, like a garment they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will have no end.”

Paul quotes [Psalm 102](#psalm-10225-27) which talks about Jehovah, and he applies it to Jesus. Jesus is the one who laid the foundation of the earth, because Jesus is Jehovah.

## 2 Peter 1:1 

> Simeon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:

Jesus is called **our Great God and Savior** by the apostle Peter. This is what the firat Christians believed.

## 2 Peter 1:17 

> For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,”

Jesus **received honor and glory from God the Father**. However scriptures like [Isaiah 42:8](#isaiah-428) and [48:11](#isaiah-4811) show that God does not allow anyone else to have equal glory to him. This means that Jesus is no one else but God. This proves the deity of Christ.

**This is my beloved Son** shows that Jesus is the [unique son of God](#monogenes), of the same substance as the Father. This proves the deity of Christ.

## Revelation 1:7 

> Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen.

Jesus is [The Cloud Rider](#the-cloud-rider), a unique attribute of God.

## Revelation 1:8 

> “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”

**The Alpha and the Omega** is a divine title emphasizing the eternity of God. This verse makes it clear that it is about God Almighty. [Revelation 1:17](#revelation-117);[2:23](#revelation-223);[22:13](#revelation-2212-13) shows that this is also a title applied to Jesus. This proves the deity of Jesus.

## Revelation 1:17 

> When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, “Fear not, I am the first and the last"

**He laid his right hand on me** shows that this was not a vision but a real life experience. John met the physical Jesus Christ, who even touched him. This is evidence that Jesus still keeps his glorified human substance (body) in heaven. Being both human and God, it makes him the only possible perfect mediator between humanity and divinity.

**The first and the last** is a divine title of Jehovah used in [Isaiah 41:4](#isaiah-414); [44:6](#isaiah-446); [48:12](#isaiah-4812). It means that he is eternal, the one whom everything begins with and ends with. As [Isaiah 44:6](#isaiah-446) points out there is only one God worthy of this title, and the fact that Jesus applies this title to himself is evidence of his divinity. He is fully God, the second person of the trinity.

## Revelation 2:23 

> and I [Jesus] will strike her children dead. And all the churches will know that I am he who searches mind and heart, and I will give to each of you according to your works.

**He who searches minds and hearts** is a reference to the old testament in passages such as [Jeremiah 17:10](#jeremiah-1710)  where it says that Jehovah search the mind, and try the heart and who give to every man according to his ways. This shows that Jesus claims to be tye same as Jehovah in these passages.

## Revelation 22:12,13 

> 12 “Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay each one for what he has done. 13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”

This passage is about Jesus, because Jesus is the one who is **coming soon**. **To repay each one for what he has done** is a reference to scriptures like [Isaiah 40:10](#isaiah-4010); [Lamentations 3:64](#lamentations-364); [Hosea 12:2](#hosea-122), which is what God will do. This is evidence that Jesus is God.

**[The First and the Last](#the-first-and-the-last)** is a divine title that only apply to the eternal God. In [Revelation 1:17](#revelation-117);[2:23](#revelation-223) and here, Jesus applies it to himself. In this verse we also see that synonymous titles the Alpha and Omega, as well as the Beginning and the End. These are all divine titles of God applied to Jesus.

# Titles of God

These are titles and epithets that identify God to an ancient Jewish reader. 

## The Cloud Rider

In the Old Testament, one of the attributes of Jehovah God is that he comes with the clouds. This was an attribute of deity in rhe ancient near east. tThe pagan nations around Israel ascribed this to Baal, but the biblical writers polemically insisted that it is Jehovah who comes with the clouds. So this idea was deeply embedded in the jewish psyche. And when Daniel 7:13 says that there will be a "[Son of Man](#the-son-of-man)" coming on the clouds, they realized that somehow Jehovah would be coming in human form as a real human. 

When Jesus later told the Sanhedrin that they would "see [the Son of Man](#the-son-of-man) coming with the clouds" they accused him of blasphemy, because saying such a thing in their ears meant saying that you are Jehovah. So in short, Jesus was condemned by the Jews because he claimed to be God.

Some 40 days later, Jesus did ascend on the clouds to the throne of God as Daniel foretold. And he will come back the same way, on the clouds in glory.

## The Son of Man

The title Jesus uses about himself more than any other is "The Son of Man." This refers to Daniel 7:13 where Daniel sees a vision of a Son of Man, meaning a human being, [coming on the clouds](#the-cloud-rider), which was something only God did. So this character was both human and god at the same time. And he sits down at the right hand of the Ancient of Days and recieve total power over and worship from the entire universe.

When Jesus told the Sanhedrin that they would "see the Son of Man [coming with the clouds](#the-cloud-rider)" they accused him of blasphemy, because saying such a thing in their ears meant saying that you are Jehovah. So in short, Jesus was condemned by the Jews because he claimed to be God.

Jesus used this title of himself all the time, and every time he does, he wants you to associate it with the fully-human, fully-God character of Daniel 7:13.

## The one to whom every knee will bow

Being the universal sovereign, God is the only one to whom every knee should bow. [Isaiah 45:23](#isaiah-4523) makes clear that ‘To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear allegiance.’ And [Romans 14:11](#romans-1411) agrees that “As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.”

However in [Philippians 2:10,11](#philippians-21011), it makes clear that the one to whom every knee will bow and every to gue confess is Jesus Christ. This proves the deity of Christ.

## The one with the highest name

## The First and the Last

## The one who sees the heart

God is the one who can see what is in a persons's heart and judge them fairly.

## The one who repays deeds

## Monogenes 

The greek word *monogenes* (μονογενής) often translated as only-begotten, is a word used to describe the relationship of the Son to the Father. For a long time translators thought that the word came from *mono* (μονο) meaning only, and *gennao* (γεννάω) meaning born. This is the word that words like "generate", "genesis", and "generation" come from. 

However recent research into other ancient literature revealed that the second part of the word rather comes from the greek word *genos* (γένος), which means kind or type. So the more accurate rendering of *monogenes* would be "one of a kind" or "unique", and it has nothing to do with being born. This is the word that words like "genetics", "genus", "gender" and "gentile" come from.

That Jesus is the **unique** son of God emphasizes that in contrast with the other spirit beings sometimes called "sons of God", Jesus is special, one of a kind. He is unique because while these spirit beings and even the human Adam are "sons" in a relational sense, like adoptive children, they are different from God in substance. Jesus however is a true son, having the same substance as the Father. They are "genetically" related, having the same "*genos*" or type. 

Since Jesus shares the same unique substance as the Father, this means they are both God, sharers in the God-substance.

### The Son of God

Jesus being "the" son of God is a shorter way of saying he is [the unique son of God](#monogenes), and not just "a" son of God.

# Attributes of God

These are attributes that only God posess. the Bible shows that both the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit posess these atteibutes, which means that they are all God, Divine.

## Omnipresence

The ability to be in any and all place at any time. 

## Omniscience

## Omnipotence

# Other phrases and idioms

## Calling on the name of

All throughout the Bible, the phrase "calling on the name of..." is without exception used for the worship of a deity. For example Genesis 4:26; 13:4; 26:25; 2 Kings 5:11; Psalm 116:4,13, 17; Joel 2:32 and Zephaniah 3:9 uses it to mean worshipping or praying to the Lord Jehovah. 1 Kings 18:24 shows it is used for Baal. So "calling on the name of" someone is an idiom for worshipping or praying to a deity. Very early on in the Christian era, even as early as the time Paul converted, Christians were well known far and wide as those calling on the name of Jesus, in other words those who worship Jesus. And they aply this on themselves in Acts 9:14,21;22:16 and 1 Corinthians 1:2. The first Christians worshipped Jesus as God.

## The Divine Council

An often overlooked feature of ancient Jewish theology is that God has a Divine Council, a royal court in heaven who cooperates with God in taking decisions. These are sometimes referred to as "the sons of God", but just like Adam, their sonship is merely relational, and not genetic. That is why the Word, Jesus, is singled out as the [unique son of God](#monogenes), because he is not simply one of these spirit beings of the council.

The council is especially visible in passages such as 2 Chronicles 18:18-22 where God consults the Divine Council on how to deal with king Ahab. In Psalm 82, God chastises members of the Divine council for not performing their responsibility to guide the nations. To learn more about the Divine Council, I recommend the book The Unseen Realm" by Dr. Michael Heiser.
