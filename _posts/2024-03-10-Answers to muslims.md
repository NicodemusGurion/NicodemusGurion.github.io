Here are explanations to some common questions and claims from Muslims about Christianity:

# "The Bible has been corrupted"

A common claim, but one that has no evidence nor scholarly support.

## Existing original Bibles 

![A page of the Codex Sinaiticus (no copyright)](https://i.ibb.co/Lt4Gp7x/E551885-E-A821-43-FC-A61-A-727941-A4-FCB2.jpg)

We have [several complete Bibles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_uncial_codices) that are several centuries older than Islam. For example the [Codex Sinaiticus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Sinaiticus) (4th century), [Codex Varicanus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Vaticanus) (4th century), [Codex Alexandrinus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Alexandrinus) (5th century), and [Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Ephraemi_Rescriptus) (5th century). This means that they are 200-400 years older than Islam itself. And they are complete or near complete Bibles. That means that we can see in them exactly what was in the Bible 1600 years ago. And their contents is identical in meaning to the contents of modern Bibles. This means that there has been **no changes** between then and now. The Bible is **exactly** the same from before islam even existed to today.

Apart from this we have the writings of the early church fathers who write between ca 50 CE and 300 CE. From their quotations alone we can reconstruct the entire New Testament and parts of the old.

Apart from these, we have smaller books, or chapters of books, or even fragments going back even farther. The oldest ones date back to 250 years before common era, that is more than 2270 years. And the passages that they contain are identical with modern Bibles.

All in all we have over 10.000 Latin manuscripts, over 6000 Greek manuscripts, over 2000 Hebrew manuscripts, and thousands of manuscripts in other ancient languages. The Bible is the most well preserved ancient text that exists. 

Historically speaking there is absolutely no evidence of any corruption or missing information.

## The Quran affirms the Bible.

[Surah 2: 88-91](https://quran.com/2/88-91)

> And when there comes to them a Book from Allah, **confirming what is with them**… When it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah Hath sent down, "they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us:" yet they reject all besides, even if it be Truth **confirming what is with them**…

The Quran confirms the Bible that "was with them", or that they had in the 7th century saying that it was uncorrupted and coming from Allah. Since the Bible is exactly the same before Islam started as it is today, and the Quran says that the Bible that the Christians and Jews had is confirmed by Allah, how can any human disagree and say that it has been corrupted?

## The Islamic dilemma 

The reason for saying the Bible is corrupted is because of what is called the Islamic dilemma.

1. The Quran says that the Bible is from Allah.
2. The Quran says no one can change the word of Allah.
3. The Quran says that the Bible has not been changed.
4. Yet the Quran also contradicts the Bible on central issues such as the crucifixion, who Jesus is, the trinity, the Fatherhood of God, salvation, justice, forgiveness, and many other topics.
5. Furthermore the Bible explicitly says that if any man or angel brings a message that is different, that man or angel is accursed by God and their message is false. (Gal 1:8)

So how do we deal with the fact that on one hand the Quran affirms and relies on the Bible as Allahs word, and on the other hand contradicts it?

One explanation is that the Quran is just the words of Muhammad, a fallible, sinful, regular man with little to no knowledge about what the Bible teaches.

But if Muslims accept that, why should anyone listen to the Quran or be Muslim? 

So they have to say that the Bible has been corrupted.

But doing so they are directly contradicting the Quran which says that it can not be corrupted.

This is the dilemma:

Either the Quran is correct in that the Bible is the true word of Allah. And if the Bible is the true word of Allah, then the Quran is false.

Or the Quran is just the words of a man, and therefore the Quran is false.

Either way, the Quran is false.
