> [2:20b](https://quran.com/2/20) Had Allah willed, He could have taken away their hearing and sight. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.

> [2:22](https://quran.com/2/22) ˹He is the One˺ Who has made the earth a place of settlement for you and the sky a canopy; and sends down rain from the sky, causing fruits to grow as a provision for you. So do not knowingly set up equals to Allah ˹in worship˺.

Allah is the creator and accepts no rivalry.

> [2:28](https://quran.com/2/28) How can you deny Allah? You were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die and again bring you to life, and then to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned.

Allah causes life and death.
