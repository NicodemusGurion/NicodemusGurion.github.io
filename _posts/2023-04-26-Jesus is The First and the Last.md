In Revelation, John meets an extraordinary figure in a vision. It is Jesus in heaven.

> Revelation 1:13 — and in the midst of the lampstands someone like a son of man, clothed in a garment that reached down to the feet and wearing a golden sash around his chest. 

Who is this? It is Jesus, the Son of Man. We know this because he introduces himself:

> Revelation 1:17 When I saw him, I fell as dead at his feet. And he laid his right hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last, 18 and the living one, and I became dead, but look! I am living forever and ever, and I have the keys of death and of the Grave.

He gives himself 4 titles:

1.  the First and the Last
2.  the living one
3.  the one who became dead, but is living forever and ever
4.  the one who has the keys of death and of the Grave

Who is the one who became dead and lives again? Jesus. Who has the keys of death and of the Grave? Jesus. Who is the living one? Jesus. But especially pay attention to his title "The First and the Last". When Jesus delivers his message to the congregations he also confirms this:

> Revelation 2:8 — “And to the angel of the congregation in Smyrʹna write: These are the things that he says, ‘the First and the Last,’ who became dead and came to life again:

Again he refers to his death and resurrection, saying he is the one who became dead and came to life again. And once again he calls himself "the First and the Last. So far we can conclude that the title "The First and the Last" belongs to Jesus Christ.

## Other titles for Jesus

> Revelation 22:12,13,20  — “‘Look! **I am coming quickly**, and the reward I give is with me, to repay each one according to his work. 13 I am the Alʹpha and the O·meʹga, **the First and the Last**, the beginning and the end. [...] 20 “The one who bears witness of these things says, ‘Yes, **I am coming quickly**.’” “Amen! Come, **Lord Jesus**.”

Who is it that will come with rewards? It is Jesus. Jesus is the judge of mankind who will reward each one according to his work. (Mat 16:27; Rev 2:23; John 5:22,23; Acts 10:42;17:31) If you are not sure, John confirms it in verse 12 and 20 where Jesus says "I am coming quickly" and John answers "Come quickly, Lord Jesus!" And as we already concluded the title "the First and the Last" belongs to Jesus. Once again it is confirmed. This shows us that Jesus has additional titles, namely "the Alpha and the Omega",  and the "Beginning and End". These both mean the same thing as "The First and the Last". They show that Jesus is eternal. So Jesus is The First and the Last, and also The Alpha and Omega, and The Beginning and the End.

> Revelation 21:6 — And he said to me: “They have come to pass! **I am the Alʹpha and the O·meʹga, the beginning and the end**. To anyone thirsting I will give from the spring of the water of life free.

So based on what we know so far, who is this talking about? Who is the First and the Last, the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End? It's Jesus. If you are uncertain, remember what  Jesus said in John 4:14:

> John 4:14 — Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty at all, but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life.”

Who is the one giving living water from the spring of life? Jesus, right? That's what the Bible tells us.

## It's getting interesting...

Let's go back to Revelation and read it including the next verse:

> Revelation 21:6,7  — And he said to me: “They have come to pass! **I am the Alʹpha and the O·meʹga, the beginning and the end**. To anyone thirsting I will give from the spring of the water of life free. 7 Anyone conquering will inherit these things, and **I will be his God** and he will be my son.

So Jesus says he will be God to those who conquer. Let's research further:

> Revelation 1:8 — “I am the Alʹpha and the O·meʹga,”...

There it is again, Jesus' title, The Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. It's Jesus. I wonder what Jesus has to say here...

> Revelation 1:8 — “I am the Alʹpha and the O·meʹga,”... says Jehovah God, “the One who is and who was and who is coming, **the Almighty.**”

Wait... Jehovah? Jesus is Jehovah? (Well, actually it says Jesus is "The Lord God" but the NWT inserts "Jehovah" here.) Let's do a quick search for "The First and the Last" in the Bible to see who it is:

> Isaiah 41:4  — Who has acted and done this, Summoning the generations from the beginning? **I, Jehovah, am the First One; And with the last ones I am the same.**”

> Isaiah 44:6 — This is what Jehovah says, The King of Israel and his Repurchaser, **Jehovah** of armies: ‘**I am the first and I am the last**. **There is no God but me.**

> Isaiah 48:12  — Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I have called. I am the same One. **I am the first; I am also the last.**

But Isaiah says that "The First and the Last" is Jehovah and that there is no one else but him called this, he is the same one, and there is no other God.

Why then is Jesus also "The First and the Last"?

## Conclusion

Jesus is the First and the Last, who is the Alpha and the Omega, who is the Beginning and the End, who is God Almighty, who is Jehovah, who is the First and the Last.

Is this true or is the Bible lying?

The only biblical and logical conclusion: Jesus is Jehovah.
