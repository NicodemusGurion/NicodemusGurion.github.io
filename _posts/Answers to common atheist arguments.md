# Religion causes wars

Only 7% of all human wars are caused by religions. And if you remove Islamic ears that number drops to 3%.

# People do evil in the name of religion

This is true, but the most murderous people in history has been atheists. This doesn't mean religion is true, it just means you can't use this as an argument against it.

# How do you know which religion is true?

Everyone, religious or not, has faith in a certain worldview. It's just that done worldviews are called religions and some are secular. But everyone has to ask the question "which worldviews best explains the world?"

By definition science can only deal with things inside the natural world. And by definition God is something outside the natural world. So this argument is meaningless.
