Joseph took care of and protected his family

> Matthew 2:14 And he [Joseph] rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt [fleeing from Herod]

Joseph made sure his family had a roof over their heads even under the most trying circumstances.

> Luke 2:16 And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger.

Joseph and Mary took good care of Jesus. He had a good home, grew big and strong.

> Luke 2:40 And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom. And the favor of God was upon him.

Joseph and Mary even took care of the spiritual health of their family

> Luke 2:41 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.

When Jesus went missing, they spent no less than three days searching for him. It was no problem really, because Jesus was mature enough at 12 to take care of himself. Also they had taught him the scriptures well.

> Luke 2:43-46 And when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it, 44 but supposing him to be in the group they went a day’s journey, but then they began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances, 45 and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching for him. 46 After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.

They worried about him.

> Luke 2:48 And when his parents saw him, they were astonished. And his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.”

They kept raising Jesus well

> Luke 2:52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man.

Even as an adult, his mother and other family members thought he had gone man and worried about him. If they didn't care they wouldn't try to go get him.

> Mark 3:21 And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, “He is out of his mind.”

The love and care goes both ways. When Jesus is dying, he is making sure that his mother will be well taken care of by one of his disciples.

> John 19:26 When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!”

The gospels paint a picture of a very healthy family unit.
