The idea of God as a multipersonal being is not an idea that developed after the first century Christian congregation got started. It is an ancient idea that goes back all the way throughout the Old Testament and Jewish prehistory. In fact first century second temple Judaism had the concept of "The Two Powers of Heaven". ((Judaism had an ancient doctrine of two (good) powers in heaven prior to Christianity. Judaism eventually declared the two powers doctrine heretical as it was a useful apologetic for the Christian belief in Jesus as God. For scholarly discussion of the two powers and the theological struggle it caused within Judaism, see Alan F. Segal, Two Powers in Heaven: Early Rabbinic Reports about Christianity and Gnosticism (repr., Waco, TX: Baylor University Press, 2012); Daniel Boyarin, “The Gospel of the Memra: Jewish Binitarianism and the Prologue to John,” Harvard Theological Review 94.3 (July 2001))) Meaning that Jehovah was somehow manifest in at least two different agents or "powers". This was part of Jewish theology until the first Christian congregation connected the idea to Jesus. Since it became such a good argument for the Trinity doctrine, the Jewish leadership abandoned it and made the idea taboo. But let's look at some examples that lead the Jews to this conclusion in the first place.
