Jehovah's witnesses have the peculiar teaching that Jesus Christ is just another name for the Archangel Michael. 

# Angels can not be mediators between God and Man

The true Jesus is both God and Man, he is both divine and human. That's how he can be a mediator between God and Men, between Divinity and Humanity.

The archangel Michael however is neither God not aman. He has no business interfering in the relationship between the two. 

# He is not eternal and infinite

Jesus came to pay the price for the sins of the whole world. all sins, past, present and future. The sins of billions of people. The only way the value of his life would be sufficient to cover all of this is if he is greater than all of humanity. Only if he is eternal and infinite would his life be valuable enough to suffice. 

The archangel Michael however is a created creature. 

# He can not be king

# He is not Jesus
