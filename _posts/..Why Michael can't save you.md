title: Why Michael can't save you
tags: [Arianism, Jehovah's witnesses]

Jehovah's witnesses have the peculiar teaching that Jesus Christ is just another name for the Archangel Michael. 

# Angels can not be mediators between God and Man

The true Jesus is both God and Man, he is both divine and human. That's how he can be a mediator between God and Men, between Divinity and Humanity.

The archangel Michael however is neither God not aman. He has no business interfering in the relationship between the two. 

# He is not eternal and infinite

Jesus came to pay the price for the sins of the whole world. all sins, past, present and future. The sins of billions of people. The only way the value of his life would be sufficient to cover all of this is if he is greater than all of humanity. Only if he is eternal and infinite would his life be valuable enough to suffice. 

The archangel Michael however is a created creature. 

# He can not be king

Hebrews specifically says that angels will not inherit the earth. Tyerefore Michael the Archangel can not inherit the earth, and therefore he can not be king of God's kingdom.

# He is not Jesus

Aprt from not being able to be wuther your mediator, savior, or king, there is no way that Jesus could be the same as Michael the Archangel.

The argument goes that since Jesus will come back with the voice of an archangel, he must therefore be an archangel.

The argument goes on to claim that therenis only one archangel, Michael.

And that's it.

However this has more holes than a Swiss cheese in a broken sieve. 

The Bible says Jesus will come back with the voice of an archangel. That means he is accompanied with such a voice. It doesn't say that it is his voice. Jesus will not come alone. It is probably the voice of an actual archangels alongside Jesus. 

Evennif the voice was his, it would not mean he is an archangel. all it would mean is that his voice would he similar to that of an archangel. 

The Bible also says Jesus will come back with the trumpet of God. Somif coming with the voive of an archabgel means he's an archange, then coming with the trumpet of God would nean that he is God. 

Also it says "an" archabgel, which means one of many. If there exiated only one, it would say "the voice of **the** archangel".

Also there is nothing that indicates therenis only one archangel. Daniel says Michael is only one of the foremost (arch) princes (angelic rulers). That James writes Michael **the** archangel doesn't meab he is the only one. It only means that that is his job title.  

So this argument has absolutely no foubdation and falls like a house of cards.

# The Bible durectly shows Jesus is not an angel

Chapters 1 and 2 of Hebrews are pretty kich all about how Jesus is not an angel.
