Jehovah's witnesses have the peculiar teaching that Jesus Christ is just another name for the Archangel Michael. 

# Angels can not be mediators between God and Man

The true Jesus is both God and Man, he is both divine and human. That's how he can be a mediator between God and Men, between Divinity and Humanity.

The archangel Michael however is neither God not aman. He has no business interfering in the relationship between the two. 

# He is not eternal and infinite

# He can not be king

# He is not Jesus
