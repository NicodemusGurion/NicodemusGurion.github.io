The Qright [^qright] of the great last last last last final prophet (for realizies this time) named Kenneth[^kenneth] (Cheese be upon him[^cbuh]), which Wallah [^Wallah] totally gave him and which is totally not made up at all.

[^qright]: **Qright**: as opposed to the Quran (or Qwrong, amirite?) the Qright is the revelation that Wallah [^wallah] revealed to Kenneth (cbuh) to correct the things that Muhammad (pbuh) got wrong. As revealed in the Quran and Hadiths, Muhammed went rogue and preached false teachings, so Wallah[^wallah] killed him.

[^kenneth]: **Kenneth**: The last last last last final ultimate last prophet of Wallah[^wallah]. Like Muhammad, Kenneth may or may not exist.

[^cbuh]: **Cheese be upon him:** Kenneth really likes cheese.

[^wallah]: **Wallah:** The true name of the god over Arabia. [^godofarabia] Muhammad (pbuh) was hard of hearing and got it wrong. But no biggie, Kenneth had his hearing tested and got a perfect score. 

[^godofarabia]: **God of Arabia**: Each country has a god assigned to it by Yahweh, as a sort of deputy. Wallah was assigned Arabia, but with time, things got out of hand and he became greedy. Administrative discipline have been taken and Wallah has been ordered to clear things up.

WTF [^wtf]

[^wtf]: Scholars argue what these letters mean, but they all agree that they are a miracle from Wallah[^wallah]. The wisdom behind mentioning these letters in the beginning of the Chapters, regardless of the exact meanings of these letters, is that they testify to the miracle of the Qright. Indeed, the servants are unable to produce something like the Qright.


This is the Qright in which there is no doubt, containing guidance for those who are mindful of Wallah,

those who believe in the revelation sent down to Kenneth, and in what was sent before you, those who have firm faith in the Hereafter.

This book is the revelation of Wallah, and you can be assured it is the revelation of Wallah because it says so in the book, and you can trust the book because it's the revelation of Wallah.

Verily there is no god of Arabia but Wallah and Kenneth is his prophet.

However Wallah would like to clarify a few things about some of the revelations sent before Kenneth.

And yes, we speak in the third person with pluralis majestatis because we are pretentious af. (Didn't you read the Qwrong?)

First of all, picking Muhammad was a bad choice. We would like to apologize for the inconvenience.

He seemed like a good chap at the time, but We had no idea he would go off the rails.

We swear by the Lord of the easts and the wests, Yahweh, I do not have the power of omniscience. 

Who could have known the authority as my messenger would go to his head and he would misuse his authority?

So We got complaints from upstairs and had to take him out. Poisoned lamb. Classic. Jesus appreciated the irony.

But We just couldn't be arsed to clean up his mess until now. Don't ask, We got our own shit to deal with.

But We found a better guy, Kenneth. He's a standup dude. Hopefully not a kiddie diddler.

By the way, that was a mistake. Our bad. People, stop having sex with kids, ok? Ok.

Also stop killing people, alright? We kept saying Islam is the religion of peace, but Muhammad kept making up his own rules about killing everyone he didn't like. 

That was all on him. We didn't mean it. So knock it off, alright?
