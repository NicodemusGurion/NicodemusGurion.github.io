A favorite gotcha question from pop atheists, this classic combines false definitions with crap logic. The argument goes like this:

*   Can God create a rock so big that he himself can't lift it?

*   If he can, he's not omnipotent.

*   If he can't he's not omnipotent.

If you are a bottom rung pop atheist looking for trolling bait, this may intrigue you. Others will immediately see a few glaring errors.

## How big is that rock?

The first premise questions God's creative powers, if he can create something so big he can't lift it. No matter the size or weight of a rock, the one who created the universe would have no problem manipulating gravity to "lift it". So the question is, can a rock heavy enough to not be lifted be created at all? Can it exist? The biggest possible rock that could be lifted from something else woukd contain half the mass of the universe, the ground from which to lift it containing the rest. But if you want it bigger you need a bigger universe. Yet no matter how big you make the universe, why wouldn’t the creator of the universe be able to control things in it? So let's go really big. What is the biggest imaginable rock? The biggest imaginable size would be an infinitely large rock. But that causes a **logical** problem. The universe is finite. Reality is finite. How would an infinitely large rock be able to exist in a finite reality? Such a thing is a logical contradiction. Logical contradictions can notexist in reality, but are nothing but figments of imagination. They can not exist in reality. They can only exist in fantasy. Examples of logical impossibilities are square circles and married bachelors. A circle is not a square. And bachelors are by definition not married. These things do not exist in reality, but are only strings of words that are grammatically sound but which don't make sense logically. Like "creating an infinitely big material object in a finite universe." That's a logical contradiction, like a married bachelor. So premise one of the question is nothing but a fantasy, a logical impossibility.

## What does omnipotent mean?

Premise two plays on the meaning of the word omnipotent. Omnipotent means "all powerful", having all power. Power is the ability to affect reality. Anything that can **logically** be possible can be accomplished with power. What it does **not** mean is the power to break the laws of logic and do what is logically impossible. But this question assumes omnipotence means being able to do the logically impossible, such as creating an object of infinite mass in a universe that is finite. The word omnipotence does not have that meaning. God can not do what is logically impossible. No one can. Not being able to do what is logically impossible has nothing to do with omnipotence. No amount of power can make the logically impossible possible. Doing the logically impossible would in essence be a lie, and lying is one of the things God can not do. Premise two of the question is therefore based on a wrong definition of the word omnipotent. And thus the whole question is meaningless.
