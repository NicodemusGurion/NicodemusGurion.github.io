A favorite gotcha question from pop atheists, this classic combines false definitions with bad logic. The argument goes like this:

*   Can God create a rock so big that he himself can't lift it?
*   If he can, he's not omnipotent.
*   If he can not, he's not omnipotent.

Seems like an inescapable dilemma. But it assumes a faulty definition of omnipotence, namely "the ability to do anything".

Omnipotence does not mean "The ability to do anything" but it means "the ability to do anything that raw power can do". And ni amount of raw power can accomplish something that is logically impossible.

Thomas Aquinas have already answered this faulty dilemma.

> "Whatever implies contradiction does not come within the scope of divine omnipotence, because it can not have the aspect of possibility."

To say God can not do something that is logically impossible does not limit God in any way. For example  God can not make a "married bachelor" or "square circle", but that's not for lack of power, but because those words simply make no sense. They're self contradictory concepts.

The same way "can God make a rock that can not be lifted?" is also meaningless because it is self contradictory, namely an omnipotent God defeating his own omnipotence. It's essentially asking "Can God be omnipotent and *not* omnipotent at the same time?" It's not a task that can be done with power, but only a contradictory combination of words, a logical absurdity. And if it's not a task that can be done with power, it is not really a problem if God can't do it.

There are many things God can't do because he is perfect.

- He can't lie because he is morally perfect.
- He can't cease to exist because he is the perfection of being.
- He can't miscalculate becayse he is the author of math.
- He can't do the logically absurd because he is perfectly logical.

## Some might say "Omnipotence should include the logically impossible"

If that's the case then the original problem automatically ceases to be a problem. We can then just agree that, yes, God **can** create a rock that he can't lift, **and** he can lift it.

But if you think thats logically contradictory, then remember that by this definition, God **can** do the logically impossible. So what's your point?

In short, this age old challenge is not actually a challenge, but only a nonsensical contradictory collection of words.
