These are my notes reading through the Quran Surah by Surah and ayah by ayah. 

[TOC]

# Al-Fatihah

The first book "The Opener" is short and mainly praises Allah.

## 1: 4

> Master of the Day of Recompense.

Allah is the Lord of judgment day. This is a title describing Jesus.

## 1: 6

> Guide us to the straight path:

Muslims pray this every time they recite the first chapter. Perhaps this is why so many Muslims are converting to Christianity, or at least apostatising from Islam. 

# Al-Baqarah

## 2: 1

> Alif-Lãm-Mĩm.

Cryptic letters that no one knows what they means. Because the Quran is so clear and easy to understand.

## 2: 2

> This is the Book! There is no doubt about it—a guide for those mindful ˹of Allah˺,

"This is the book! Because the book said so! And it's the book, so it must be the book!" Basically "Trust me bro." It spells out the purpose of the Quran, an instruction manual. Not like the Bible which contains history, wisdom, doctrine, and specific instructions to specific people, the Quran is just a general instruction manual for all times and places.

## 2: 3

> ...donate from what We have provided for them,

Charity is important in Islam because it's a legalistic works righteousness religion, so you need ways to score brownie points. 

## 2: 4

> ...who believe in what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺and what was revealed before you...

Those who believe in Muhammad should also believe in what was revealed before him, that is the Bible and it's prophets. The Quran tells Muslims to believe the Bible, but the Muslims tells me that the Bible has been corrupted. Whom should I trust? Allah, or the Muslims who say Allah is wrong?

## 2: 7

> Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and over their sight is a veil; for for them is a great punishment.

Discussing unbelievers, it says that Allah has caused them to not believe and that therefore he will punish them. Bruh!?

## 2: 8-20

This sections discuss people who say they believe but do not.

## 2: 10

> In their hearts is sickness, so Allah increased their sickness, and for them is a painful punishment on account of how they used to lie 

Discussing fake believers, Allah is not helping them, but making their condition worse, so he can punish them. Unloving.

## 2: 18

> ... Allah took away their1light and left them in darkness(es) ,unable to see.

Again Allah is not being helpful.

## 2: 20

> The lightning almost snatches their sight(s) away; whenever it illuminates for them, they walk in it. But when it darkens over them, they stand(still) . And had Allah willed, He could have done away with their hearing and their sight(s ). Indeed, Allah is All-Powerful over everything.

It seems as though Allah likes to play a cruel cat and mouse game with deniers. Why wouldn’t he rather want to lead them into his truth?

## 2: 23

> And if youpl are in doubt about what We have bestowed upon Our servant from on high, then bring a single surah of its like, and call your witnesses apart from Allah if you are truthful.

This famous challenge is that the Quran is the word of Allah because if it's literary quality. Well, so far it has not backed up it's claim. Everything thus far has been humdrum and uninspired. The bit about the lightning was probably the highlight so far, but it's far from impressive.

Literary excellence is a really weird  condition for divine inspiration. I mean, in that case any half decent poet is more inspired than Allah and Muhammad.

But let's write a Surah better than what we've seen so far. It doesn't have to rhyme, just sound pretty. And judging from Surah 108, 3 verses should be enough. So how about this:

> The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. 
> He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. 
> Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 
> You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 
> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

How did I do?
