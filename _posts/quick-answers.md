Since Muslim debaters never put any thought into their incoherent contradictory ridiculous Dawah claims, why should Christians waste time and energy refuting them? (Matthew 7:6) Here is a list of canned responses to the most common nonsense, in neat paragraphs less than 200 characters, perfect for limited messaging platforms such as TikTok or X.

# "The Bible has been corrupted"

Today we have 4 complete Bibles from the 4th century. They are two hundred years older than Islam and they are identical in content with modern Bibles. This alone proves there has been no changes.

Apart from 4 complete Bibles, we also have tens of thousands of manuscripts that date back 2300 years, and they match up perfectly with modern Bibles, proving there has been no corruption.

Apart from complete Bibles and manuscripts, the early church fathers heavily quoted the New Testament, giving us yet another layer of confirmation that it has been accurately preserved.

The Quran repeatedly confirms the authenticity, integrity, and divine origin of the Christian and Jewish scriptures that were available in Arabia in the 7th century B.C.

Surah 2:4,40-41,89,91,97,101,113,121;3:3-4,23,58,78-79,81,93,184;4:47;5:44,46,48,66,68,84;6:91-92;10:37,94;12:111;16:43;20:133;21:7,48,105;26:196;28:48-49;29:27;35:25,31;37:37;40:53;46:12,30;87:18-19

The Quran confirms that the Bible that Muhammad had access to in the 7th century is the word of Allah. (2:89;5:68) It also says that no one can change the word of Allah. (6:115; 18:27)

Since both archaeology and the Quran confirms that the Bible has not been changed in the last 1800 years, claiming that it has been corrupted is kufr (كفر) and means you're not a Muslim anymore.

# "Rebecca was 3 years old when Isaac married her"

See ["Rebecca was only 3 years old when Isaac married her"](/Rebecca-was-only-3-years-old)

**Note:** The argument goes that Isaac was born when his mother was 90, and his mother Sarah died at the age of 127, when Isaac was 37 years old. (Genesis 17:17;21:2-5;23:1) Before she died, Genesis 22:20-24 mentions that Bethuel became father to Rebecca. And since Isaac was 40 when he married Rebecca, this would mean Rebecca was only 3 years old when Isaac married her. (Genesis 25:20) The argument is put forth to defend [the fact that Muhammad married a 6 year old child.](/quran-and-hadiths#child-sexual-abuse), as if Isaac did something similar it would make pedophilia morally good.

## Would it justify pedophilia?

That Rebecca was 3 years old can be proven to be a blatant lie. But even if it was true, why would the conduct of Isaac justify pedophilia? Do you believe pedophilia is morally good?

If it was true that Isaac married a 3 year old, then Isaac was just as horrible as Muhammad. We Christians do not follow the example of Isaac, but muslims do follow the example of Muhammad.

If Isaac married a 3 year old, he would be a horrible human being. So you use a horrible person to defend your prophet, showing your prophet is a horrible person whose behavior is morally repugnant.

If that was true, then by using the Bible as an authority to defend Muhammad, you acknowledge that the Bible is morally superior to the Quran and that he is no better than the worst possible sinner.

## Is it true?

That Rebecca was 3 years old when marrying Isaac is a lie. There is no way to prove that. According to the text she was an independent adult woman. (Genesis 24:5,8,14,16,28,39,43-44,55,57-58)

An average camel can drink 200 liters of water. No 3 year old has the strength or stamina to carry 2000 liters of water to ten camels. (Genesis 24:10)

In Genesis 22:20-24 Abraham gets the news that no less than 14 relatives in 2 generations have been born. If this means Rebecca is 3 years old then all 14 of them would also be 3 years old.

The news mentioning Rebecca covered what had happened to Abraham's relatives the last 60 years. Rebecca's birth could be anywhere within that timespan, so it can't be used to pinpoint her age.


When Isaac was almost sacrificed, he was called a boy, It's very rare for the Bible to call someone older than 17 a "boy"
