The Islamic dilemma is a logical problem with the Quran and Islamic teaching, whereas the Quran affirms that the Bible is the uncorrupted word of God, however it also contradicts the Bible, and the Bible rejects the Quran.

# Premises

## P1. The Quran affirms that the Bible is the Word of Allah/God.



## P2. The Quran affirms that the Word of Allah (the Bible) can not be changed or corrupted.

## P3. The Quran contradicts the Bible.

## P4. The Bible rejects the truthfulness of the Quran.

# Conclusions

If the Bible is not the word of Allah (P1), then the Quran is false.

If the Bible is corrupted (P2), then the Quran is false.

If the Quran is true and the Bible is false (P3), then P1 and P2 is false, and thus the Quran is false.

If the Bible is correct then the Quran is false. (P4)

If the Bible is correct in P1 and P2, and the Quran contradicts the Bible in P3, then the Quran is false.

If the Quran is correct in P1 and P2 then the Bible is true, and if the Bible is true (P4) then the Quran is false. 

If P3 and/or P4 is true, then either P1 and/or P2 are false, which means the Quran is false.

# Common rebuttals

## "The Bible has been corrupted"

This goes against what the Quran says in P1 and P2. See also ["The Bible has been corrupted"](/the-Bible-has-been-corrupted).

# Summary

There is no logical combination in which P1-4 can all be true, and therefore in every possible case, the Quran is false. And if the Quran is false, Muhammad was a false prophet and Islam is a false religion.
