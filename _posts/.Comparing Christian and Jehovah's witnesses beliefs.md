|Salvation through...|To be saved you need to have faith in Jesus Christ. (Romans 10:9; Ephesians 2:8,9)|To be saved you need to do works, for example take in knowledge, dedicate your life to Jehovah, get baptized, obey God’s laws, belong to the Watchtower organization, preach, devote all time, energy and resources to earn this gift. ((https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2019602#h=36)) ((https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1952601#h=5)) ((https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1983124#h=9))|
|Assurance of salvation.|You are saved and given eternal life the moment you put faith in Jesus. ((John 3:36;Romans 8:1,2;10:9; Ephesians 1:13,14;Titus 3:5;Acts 16:31;))|You are not saved immediately. Jesus only gave you the opportunity to be saved. But you have to stay loyal all your life, through the great tribulation, through Armageddon, through another thousand years, through the final test, and then you will be saved.|
