#Jesus

## Divinity of Jesus Christ

## Resurrection of Jesus 

**Jehovah's witnesses**

Jesus was not resurrected bodily. His body was dissolved into atoms, and his appearances were only him materializing 

**Christianity**

# Salvation

## Salvation through what?

**Jehovah's witnesses**

To be saved you need to do works, for example take in knowledge, dedicate your life to Jehovah, get baptized, obey God’s laws, belong to the Watchtower organization, preach, as well as devoting all time, energy and resources to earn this gift.

**Christianity**
 
We are saved by grace through faith in Christ Jesus, not of our own works, it is a free gift that we can do nothing to earn or be worthy of. (Romans 10:9; Ephesians 2:8,9)

## When do you become saved?

**Jehovah's witnesses**

You are not saved immediately. Jesus only gave you the opportunity to be saved. But you have to stay loyal all your life, through the great tribulation, through Armageddon, through another thousand years, through the final test, and then you will be saved.

**Christianity**

You are saved and given eternal life the moment you put faith in Jesus. Salvation and eternal life is a state of existence that begins with trust in Jesus. (John 3:36;Romans 8:1,2;10:9; Ephesians 1:13,14; Titus 3:5;Acts 16:31;)

# Death

## What happens when you die?




# Hope for the future

## How many hopes do Christians have?

**Jehovah's witnesses**

Two hopes. JWs are divided into two groups. One that upon death turn into spirits and live eternally in heaven, and one who will stay human and live forever on earth.

**Christianity**

One hope. All Christians are anounted. The souls of all Christians rest with the Lord at death, awaiting resurrection. And in the future, the souls of all Christians are resurrected into physical bodies living on earth.  (Ephesians 4:4)
