# Salvation

## Salvation through what?

**Christianity**

We are saved by geace theough faith in Christ Jesus, not ofnour own works, it is a free gift that we can do nothing to earn or be worthy of. (Romans 10:9; Ephesians 2:8,9) 
**Jehovah's witnesses**

To be saved you need to do works, for example take in knowledge, dedicate your life to Jehovah, get baptized, obey God’s laws, belong to the Watchtower organization, preach, as well as devoting all time, energy and resources to earn this gift.

## When are you saved?

**Christianity**

You are saved and given eternal life the moment you put faith in Jesus. (John 3:36;Romans 8:1,2;10:9; Ephesians 1:13,14; Titus 3:5;Acts 16:31;)

**Jehovah's witnesses**

You are not saved immediately. Jesus only gave you the opportunity to be saved. But you have to stay loyal all your life, through the great tribulation, through Armageddon, through another thousand years, through the final test, and then you will be saved.
