title: What the Quran teaches about Jesus
tags: [Islam, Jesus, Quran, Lists]

Our Muslim friends keep saying Jesus is a respected prophet in their religion. They also try to steal Jesus from Christians by claiming such nonsense as "Jesus was a Muslim." Funny how Muslims feel they need to appropriate Jesus to make their religion seem remotely legitimate. Meanwhile Christians wouldn’t touch Muhammad with a proverbial ten mile pole.

But I digress. So what does the Quran actually say about Jesus, and what can we learn about him. These are all the verses that mention Jesus (34) and Messiah (8). With each verse I will point out what we can learn about Jesus and whether it is true of false.

Surah 2:87

> And We did certainly give Moses the Torah and followed up after him with messengers. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Pure Spirit. But is it [not] that every time a messenger came to you, [O Children of Israel], with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And a party [of messengers] you denied and another party you killed.

- Jesus is the Son of Mary.
- Jesus has the Holy Spirit.

Surah 2:136

> Say, [O believers], “We have believed in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.”

Jesus...

- was given something. (Unclear what.)

Also the claim is generally false. Muslims do not actually believe the things that was revealed to any of these people. 


Surah 2:253

> Those messengers – some of them We caused to exceed others. Among them were those to whom Allah spoke, and He raised some of them in degree. And We gave Jesus, the Son of Mary, clear proofs, and We supported him with the Pure Spirit. If Allah had willed, those [generations] succeeding them would not have fought each other after the clear proofs had come to them. But they differed, and some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. And if Allah had willed, they would not have fought each other, but Allah does what He intends.

Jesus...

- Is the Son of Mary. (True)
- Has the Holy Spirit. (True)
- Had clear proofs. (True)


Surah 3:45 

> [And mention] when the angels said, “O Mary, indeed Allah gives you good tidings of a word from Him, whose name will be the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary – distinguished in this world and the Hereafter and among those brought near [to Allah ].

Jesus is:

- The Son of Mary. (True)
- The Messiah. (True)
- The Word of God. (True)
- Distinguished or special. (True)
- Near to God. (True)

Surah 3:52

> But when Jesus felt [persistence in] disbelief from them, he said, “Who are my supporters for [the cause of] Allah ?” The disciples said,” We are supporters for Allah . We have believed in Allah and testify that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].

- Jesus once asked his followers for support. (Unknown)
- his followers claimed to be Muslim. (False)

Surah 3:55

> [Mention] when Allah said, “O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your return, and I will judge between you concerning that in which you used to differ.

Jesus...

- Is raised up to the throne of God. (True)
- Purified from those who disbelieve. (What does that even mean? False)
- Has followers who will be superior until resurrection day. (True. Christians.)
- Will be judged by Allah. (False. Jesus himself is the judge of all mankind.)



Surah 3:59

> Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created Him from dust; then He said to him, “Be,” and he was.

Jesus...

- Is an example to Allah? (Meaning unclear)

Surah 3:84

> Say, “We have believed in Allah and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Descendants, and in what was given to Moses and Jesus and to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [submitting] to Him.”

See 2:136.



Surah 4:157

> And [for] their saying, “Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah .” And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but it was made to appear so to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain.

Jesus...

- Was not crucified. (False)
- Did not die. (False)

The crucifixion and death of Jesus is the most certain fact of ancient history. This verse alone destroys Islam's claim to truth.

Surah 4:163

> Indeed, We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him. And we revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the Descendants, Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the book [of Psalms].

Jesus....

- Got a revelation. (True)

Surah 4:171

O People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a messenger of Allah and His word which He directed to Mary and a spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, “Three”; desist – it is better for you. Indeed, Allah is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs.

Jesus...

- Is the son of Mary (True)
- Is the Word of God (True)
- Is a spirit from Allah. (True)

Surah 4:172

Never would the Messiah disdain to be a servant of Allah , nor would the angels near [to Him]. And whoever disdains His worship and is arrogant – He will gather them to Himself all together.

Jesus...

- Was a servant of God (True, during his earthly ministry.)

Surah 5:17

> They have certainly disbelieved who say that Allah is the Christ , the son of Mary. Say, “Then who could prevent Allah at all if He had intended to destroy the Christ, the son of Mary, or his mother or everyone on the earth?” And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. He creates what He wills, and Allah is over all things competent.

Jesus...

- Is the son of Mary (True)
- Allah is not the Christ. (False, Jesus is God.)

Surah 5:46

> And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light and confirming that which preceded it of the Torah as guidance and instruction for the righteous.

Jesus...

- Is the son of Mary (True)
- Confirmed the Torah. (True)
- Was given the gospel. (The meaning of gospel is unclear. Jesus preached the gospel about the kingdom. But the gospel accounts are stories about what Jesus did.)

Surah 5:72

> They have certainly disbelieved who say, "Allāh is the Messiah, the son of Mary" while the Messiah has said, "O Children of Israel, worship Allāh, my Lord and your Lord." ...

Jesus...

- Is not God (False)
- Taught "worship Allah , my Lord and your lord." (False)



Surah 5:75

> The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. They both used to eat food. Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.

Jesus...

- Is the son of Mary. (True)
- Is nothing but a messenger. (False, he is much more than that.)
- Ate food. (True)

Surah 5:78

> Cursed were those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel by the tongue of David and of Jesus, the son of Mary. That was because they disobeyed and [habitually] transgressed.

Jesus...

- Is the Son of Mary. (True)

Surah 5:110

> [The Day] when Allah will say, “O Jesus, Son of Mary, remember My favor upon you and upon your mother when I supported you with the Pure Spirit and you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and [remember] when I taught you writing and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and when you designed from clay [what was] like the form of a bird with My permission, then you breathed into it, and it became a bird with My permission; and you healed the blind and the leper with My permission; and when you brought forth the dead with My permission; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from [killing] you when you came to them with clear proofs and those who disbelieved among them said, “This is not but obvious magic.”

Jesus...

- Learned things. (True)
- Spoke from the cradle. (False. That's from the false second century infancy gospel of Thomas)
- Created clay birds. (False. That's from the false second century infancy gospel of Thomas)
- Healed blind and lepers. (True)
- Raised the dead. (True)
- Was protected by God from being killed before his time. (True)

Surah 5:112

> [And remember] when the disciples said, “O Jesus, Son of Mary, can your Lord send down to us a table [spread with food] from the heaven? [Jesus] said,” Fear Allah , if you should be believers.”

Jesus...

- Is the son of Mary (True)
- Brought down a table from heaven. (False. Though he did feed people miraculously.)

[5:114] Jesus, the son of Mary said, “O Allah , our Lord, send down to us a table [spread with food] from the heaven to be for us a festival for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from You. And provide for us, and You are the best of providers.”

[5:116] And [beware the Day] when Allah will say, “O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, ‘Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah ?'” He will say, “Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen.

[6:85] And Zechariah and John and Jesus and Elias – and all were of the righteous.

[9:30] The Jews say, “Ezra is the son of Allah “; and the Christians say, “The Messiah is the son of Allah .” That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved [before them]. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?

[9:31] They have taken their scholars and monks as lords besides Allah , and [also] the Messiah, the son of Mary. And they were not commanded except to worship one God; there is no deity except Him. Exalted is He above whatever they associate with Him.

[19:34] That is Jesus, the son of Mary – the word of truth about which they are in dispute.

[33:7] And [mention, O Muhammad], when We took from the prophets their covenant and from you and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus, the son of Mary; and We took from them a solemn covenant.

[42:13] He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon Noah and that which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus – to establish the religion and not be divided therein. Difficult for those who associate others with Allah is that to which you invite them. Allah chooses for Himself whom He wills and guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him].

[43:61] And indeed, he [i.e., Jesus] will be [a sign for] knowledge of the Hour, so be not in doubt of it, and follow Me. This is a straight path.

[43:63] And when Jesus brought clear proofs, he said, “I have come to you with wisdom and to make clear to you some of that over which you differ, so fear Allah and obey me.

[57:27] Then We sent following their footsteps Our messengers and followed [them] with Jesus, the son of Mary, and gave him the Gospel. And We placed in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and mercy and monasticism, which they innovated; We did not prescribe it for them except [that they did so] seeking the approval of Allah . But they did not observe it with due observance. So We gave the ones who believed among them their reward, but many of them are defiantly disobedient.

[61:6] And [mention] when Jesus, the son of Mary, said, “O children of Israel, indeed I am the messenger of Allah to you confirming what came before me of the Torah and bringing good tidings of a messenger to come after me, whose name is Ahmad.” But when he came to them with clear evidences, they said, “This is obvious magic.”

[61:14] O you who have believed, be supporters of Allah , as when Jesus, the son of Mary, said to the disciples, “Who are my supporters for Allah ?” The disciples said, “We are supporters of Allah .” And a faction of the Children of Israel believed and a faction disbelieved. So We supported those who believed against their enemy, and they became dominant.
