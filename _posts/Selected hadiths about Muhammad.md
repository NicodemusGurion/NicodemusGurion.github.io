# Mohammad

Things that Mohammad did.

## Mohammed married and had sex with a prepubescent child

Aisha, the favorite wife of Muhammad, was 6 years old when Muhammad married her, and he had sex with their when she was only 9 years old. She was prepubescent, still playing with dolls together with her playmates. Dolls are usually forbidden but we're allowed for Aisha since she was a "little girl" so young that normal Islamic rules didn't yet apply to her.

[Sunna an Nasa'i 3378](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3378)

> "The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls."

[Sahih al Bukhari 6130](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130)

> Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger  used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was **a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.**) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)

## Muhammed used to put his face into Aishas crotch and recite Quran verses when she was menstruating

[Sunan Ibn Majah 634](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:634)

> It was narrated that 'Aishah said: "The Messenger of Allah used to put his head in my lap when I was menstruating and recite Qur'an."

## Muhammad used to fondle Aisha when she was menstruating

[Sahih al Bukhari 299](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:299)

> Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet  and I used to take a bath from a single pot while we were Junub. During the menses, he used to order me to put on an Izar (dress worn below the waist) and used to fondle me. While in I'tikaf, he used to bring his head near me and I would wash it while I used to be in my periods (menses).

## How did Muhammad die?

### Allah promises to cut off his aorta if he tells a lie

[Quran 69:44-47](https://quran.com/69?startingVerse=44)

 >Had the Messenger made up something in Our Name, We would have certainly seized him by his right hand, then severed his aorta, and none of you could have shielded him ˹from Us˺!

[Musnad Ahmad 107](https://sunnah.com/ahmad:107)

> And if he (Muhammad ﷺ) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah). We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), And then **We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta)**, And none of you could have withheld Us from (punishing) him...”

So Allah promises that Muhammed ever acts as a false prophet, Allah will cut off his aorta.

### Muhammad eats a poisoned lamb

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 4512](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4512)

> Narrated Abu Hurairah: ...So a Jewess presented him at Khaybar with a roasted sheep which she had poisoned. The Messenger of Allah  ate of it and the people also ate. He then said: Take away your hands (from the food), for it has informed me that it is poisoned. Bishr ibn al-Bara' ibn Ma'rur al-Ansari died. So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess (and said to her): What motivated you to do the work you have done? She said: If you were a prophet, it would not harm you; but if you were a king, I should rid the people of you. The Messenger of Allah  then ordered regarding her and she was killed. He then said about the pain of which he died: I continued to feel pain from the morsel which I had eaten at Khaybar. This is the time when **it has cut off my aorta.**

- [Sunnah Abu Dawud 4510](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4510)

After Muhammad kills the whole male Jewish population of Khaibar, a Jewish woman offers him roasted lamb. Being arguably the dumbest person in history, Muhammad accepts it. And it turns out that it was poisoned. Some of his men died, but Muhammad was affected for a long time from the lingering poison. Notice that Muhammad is saying that the pain from the poison feels like it is cutting off his aorta.

### Muhammad dies

[Sahih al Bukhari 4428](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4428)
  
> Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet  in his ailment in which he died, used to say, "O `Aisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, **I feel as if my aorta is being cut** from that poison."

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 4513](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4513)

> ...I do not think about the illness of my son except the poisoned sheep of which he had eaten with you at Khaybar. The Prophet  said: And I do not think about my illness except that. **This is the time when it cut off my aorta**...

Muhammad eventually died from the poisoned lamb of a jewish woman, and he did so while complaining that he felt as if his aorta was being cut. This is exactly how Allah said he would die if he was a false prophet.

Notice also the poetic biblical references in that a false anti-christ prophet was killed by Allah after eating of the Lamb that came from a Jewish woman.

## What was the last words of Muhammad?

While Jesus used his last moments to forgive his enemies, Muhammad used his last moments to curse one third of the world population.

[Sahih Muslim 531](https://sunnah.com/muslim:531)

>  'A'isha and Abdullah reported: As the Messenger of Allah  was about to breathe his last, he drew his sheet upon his face and when he felt uneasy, he uncovered his face and said in that very state: Let there be curse upon the Jews and the Christians that they have taken the graves of their apostles as places of worship. He in fact warned (his men) against what they (the Jews and the Christians) did.

## What was the last action of Muhammad?

Sharing a toothbrush with two other people.

[Sahih al Bukhari 4450](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4450)

> Aisha added, "The Prophet  expired on the day of my turn in my house and he was taken unto Allah while his head was against my chest and his saliva mixed with my saliva." 'Aisha added, "Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr came in, carrying a Siwak he was cleaning his teeth with. Allah's Messenger  looked at it and I said to him, 'O 'AbdurRahman! Give me this Siwak.' So he gave it to me and I cut it, chewed it (it's end) and gave it to Allah's Messenger  who cleaned his teeth with it while he was resting against my chest."

## Muhammad didn't leave an inheritance for his wives and daughters 

Instead they had to go to Abu Bakr to get what they needed to survive as a charity.

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 2969](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2969)

> Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin: Fatimah was demanding (the property of) sadaqah of the Messenger of Allah  at Medina and Fadak, and what remained from the fifth of Khaybar. Aisha quoted AbuBakr as saying: The Messenger of Allah  said: We are not inherited; whatever we leave is sadaqah (charity). The family of Muhammad will eat from this property, that is, from the property of Allah. They will not take more then their sustenance.

Muhammad's daughter Fatima was denied her inheritance.

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 2976](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2976)

> Narrated 'Aishah: When the Messenger of Allah  died, the wives of the Prophet  intended to send 'Uthman b. 'Affan to Abu Bakr to ask him their cost of living from (the inheritance of) the Prophet . Thereupon 'Aishah said: Did not the Messenger of Allah  say: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah.

The wives of Muhammad were also denied an inheritance.

## The parents of Muhammad are in hell

[Sahih Muslim 976b](https://sunnah.com/muslim/11/135)

> Abu Huraira reported: The Apostle of Allah  visited the grave of his mother and he wept, and moved others around him to tears, and said: **I sought permission from my Lord to beg forgiveness for her but it was not granted to me**, and I sought permission to visit her grave and it was granted to me so visit the graves, for that makes you mindful of death.

Muhammad was not allowed to ask forgiveness for his mother, meaning Allah will not forgive her, meaning she is in hell.

[Sunan Abu Dawud 4718](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4718)

> Anas said : A man asked : where is my father, Messenger of Allah? He replied! Your father is in Hell. When he turned his back, he said : **My father and your father are in Hell.**

Muhammad's father is in hell.

## Muhammad was the first Muslim

[Quran 6:14](https://quran.com/6/14)

> Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Will I take any guardian other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who provides for all and is not in need of provision?” Say, “I have been commanded to be the first to submit and not be one of the polytheists.”

## Allah considered Muhammad the perfect example

[Quran 33:21](https://quran.com/33/21)

> Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for whoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah often.

[Quran 68:4](https://quran.com/68/4)

> And you are truly a man of outstanding character.
