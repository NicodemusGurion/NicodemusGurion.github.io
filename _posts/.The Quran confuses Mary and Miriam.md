[In the Quran 19:27,28 we read:](https://quran.com/19?startingVerse=27)

> Then she returned to her people, carrying him. They said ˹in shock˺, “O Mary! You have certainly done a horrible thing! O  **sister of Aaron**!1 Your father was not an indecent man, nor was your mother unchaste.”

[Surah 66:12 also gives us this information](https://quran.com/66/12):

> ˹There is˺ also ˹the example of˺ Mary, **the daughter of ’Imrân**, who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her ˹womb˺ through Our angel ˹Gabriel˺.1 She testified to the words of her Lord and His Scriptures, and was one of the ˹sincerely˺ devout.

Surah 19 details an apocryphal story about Mary the mother of Jesus. Surah 66:12 also talks about Mary the mother of Jesus. She was a young woman living in Galilee in the first centuries BC/AD. However surah 19 and calls her "sister of Aaron". And surah 66 calls her the daughter of Imram (or Amram in Hebrew). The problem is that the one who was sister of Aaron and daughter of Amram was a completely different woman, Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron who in Exodus came out of Egypt with the Israelites. Miriam lived **about 1400 years earlier** than Mary. Their names are similar, but for the "perfect word of Allah" to mistake two radically different people living almost a millennia and a half apart in different parts of the world is just embarrassing.
