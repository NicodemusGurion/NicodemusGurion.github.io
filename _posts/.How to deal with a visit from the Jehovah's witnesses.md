You're at home minding your own business and there's a knock on the door or ring on the doorbell. Usually no one comes to your door without notice. You haven’t ordered anything nor expected anyone to drop by. You look in real peep hole and see the neatly dressed couple outside. It's the Jehovah's witnesses. What do you do?

## What you must know

### About the group:

The Jehovahs witnesses are a high control group (colloquially know a as a cult) with a outwardly Christian appearance. It was originally founded by an young haberdasher named Charles Taze Russel from Pennsylvania in 1874\. He started the corporation called the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, which has since been the legal representative of the group, and from where the leaders control it. 

The group itself was originally called the International Bible Students Association. The second leader named Joseph Rutherford later rebranded the group as "Jehovah's witnesses" in 1931. 

They believe many things that are not considered Christian. For example they believe that Jesus was not divine but just an angel that morphed into a human to die for the sins of Adam. They deny things like humans having a conscious soul that survives the death of the body. They believe that only 144.000 VIP members of their religion will go to heaven and rule as kings, while the other members need to serve them for over a thousand years to earn their salvation. They are also known for things like not celebrating birthdays and most holidays, and not accepting blood transfusions even if it means certain death. All of these beliefs are based on misinterpretations of the Bible. 

The group is an apocalyptic doomsday cult whose central message is that God will soon judge the world and kill everyone who is not a Jehovah's Witness (i.e. 99.9% of the world population, including babies and kids). Hence it is imperative that you join the cult because that's the only way to survive. They have predicted the date for this Armageddon event at least 8 times and their predictions have always failed. To most people they are probably know for their incessant evangelizing work, often from door to door, which is why you are disturbed on Saturday mornings.

### About the people:

The members of the Jehovah's witnesses are usually good people. They are trying their best to be a good person, but are caught unawares in a system that exploits this. Remember that the persons that come to your door **are not your enemy.** They are lost and misled people who have been caught up in an abusive cult. They are actually the **victims** in this situation. So doing any of the things mentioned in the "Do not do" part of this tutorial is not only **not going to work**, doing them will actually harm someone who is innocent. Being a decent person you don't want to do that, do you? 

Probably the majority of Jehovahs witnesses are so called "PIMI", physically in and mentally in. They are hard core indoctrinated and truly believe in what they teach. However, a sizable minority of them, probably several hundreds of thousands, are what's called "PIMO", or physically in but mentally out. These are members who joined at some point, invested their whole life into it, and then one day they realized that it was all a big scam. But the problem is that now they and their entire family and all the friends they have, their entire support network, are all Jehovah's witnesses. And the thing about cults is that **if you leave, you will be punished.** 

More specifically the Jehovah's witnesses preferred type of punishment for leaving the cult is ostracism. Meaning that they will all cut off every relationship with the one who leaves, even familial relationships like parent-child or siblings. They will be completely disowned and treated like they are dead. or worse than dead, because people still talk about their dead loved ones now and then. 

Not only that, they will be viciously slandered by the remaining cult members, called "mentally diseased", "weak", "disgusting" "failure" and so on. Anything good they ever did or any good reputation they ever had will be completely tarnished and dragged through the mud. Jehovahs witnesses are indoctrinated that doing this is "loving". 

They even treat their leaders this way if they fall out of favor. in 2023, former leader Anthony Morris suddenly disappeared from prominence. The only mention of this was a short notice on their web page that was up for 4-5 days and then disappeared. It informed that he was no ponger a governing body member. No mention if any reasons. No mention of it being voluntary or forced. No appreciation shown for his many years if service. No one knows exactly what happened. He was just gone, like he never existed. And then slowly, the videos and articles mentioning him started to decrease as the Watchtower silently erased any evidence that he ever existed.

But even people who are not PIMO are usually not very zealous when evangelizing. They will walk slow, find excuses for not talking to people, be negligent in following up interested ones, and so on. Because face it, visiting strangers and talking about your cult is not fun! Most of them only see it as an opportunity to have a nice walk and a chat with a friend occasionally interrupted by having to talk to someone out of guilt. 

The reason they force themselves to go out and evangelize is because the cult has falsely taught them that it is a requirement for salvation. They literally believe that if they don't do at least one hour of evangelism every month, God is going to kill them. So when they come to your door, please don't see an annoying Jesus freak who come to ruin your morning. What you need to see is a lost souls, a victim caught up in a toxic manipulative cult system. And even if they know it themselves and would want to leave, they can't do so without basically ruining their own lives.

## What NOT to do

When asked how they deal with Jehovah's witnesses, many people will suggest things that they think are effective, funny or both. In fact they are neither effective nor funny. Common reactions are to be angry, insult, scream, threaten or otherwise abuse them.

Other people suggest more creative ways like pretending to be Satan worshipers, or answering the door naked.

While amusing to the adolescent mind, these things will do nothing to help the situation. The true purpose of the Jehovah's witnesses going from door to door is not to convert people - This activity is actually extremely fruitless in that regard. No, the true purpose is to **reinforce their own indoctrination**. Jehovah's witnesses are told that only they are good and that everyone else in the whole world are evil and influenced by the devil. They are told that anyone being even slightly annoyed with them is a form of persecution and that being persecuted is a sign that they are right and have God's approval and everyone else are evil. 

When they preach they are always at least two, because they are supposed to self-indoctrinate by talking about their beliefs with one another. Being together also offers a sense of security, because approaching strangers to talk about an unpopular topic and getting yelled at over and over again is a scary and traumatic experience. When anyone yells at them, threatens them, or acts like a clown to mock them, they see this as confirmation that what they believe is true. This drives them back into the "safety" of the cult and  it reinforces their belief that everyone out there in the scary world are evil. By being hostile, you are only making a cult victim even more dependent on the cult. Bravo!

## What to do

Simply be kind and show love. You don't have to listen, you just need to **treat them with basic human decency**. If you are not interested or you do not have the time, just say so in a kind and loving way. Wish them a nice day. That's the bare minimum that everyone can and should do. If everyone did that at least, they would very soon start to notice that all you "evil" people in "Satan's world" are not so bad after all. Perhaps you might even be better than some other cult members they know. 

If you want to do more, invite them in for a cuppa tea or coffee, have them sit down, give them some treat, show some sort of hospitality. Make sure they come back. The more loving and generous you are, and the more exposure they have for good non-cult members, the more it is going to cause cognitive dissonance in their minds as they can't understand why someone "controlled by the devil" is being nice to them. 

If you feel like you really want to do a good deed, then feign interest in what they teach. You don't have to accept anything they say of course. Just ask them questions about what they believe. Go into details. The more they lay it out, the more the inconsistencies and illogical points will stand out. Ask them about these. Prod and poke. For example:

* Are the people who write your pamphlets and articles inspired or infallible? (If not, then it's just some human interpretation? Why trust it? [Relevant teaching](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2017283#h=23))
* If you would find something in your literature that contradicts what the Bible says, which one will you trust?
* Does your literature say that the only way to understand the Bible is through the explanation of your governing body? ([Relevant teaching](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1994721#h=30))
* How does your religion treat former members? ([Relevant teaching](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2017603#h=30))
* Is it true that your organization teaches that Jesus is only the mediator for a select group of your members and not for all? ([Relevant teaching](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1979250#h=4))
* How does Jehovah know that the "anointed" will be forever loyal, but you who are not anointed still have to go through a 1000 year trial period?
* God is love. (1 John 4:8) But love is a relationship isn't it? It can't exist unless there is someone to love. So before Jesus was created, whom did God love?
* If everyone who dies before Armageddon will be resurrected but everyone who dies during Armageddon will not be resurrected. What if the worst possible criminal dies one second **before** Armageddon starts, and an innocent baby dies one second **after** Armageddon starts, does that mean the criminal will be resurrected and the baby destroyed forever?
* If Romans 6:7 means that death clears all our sins, then why would we need Jesus ransom? We could all just commit suicide and go straight to paradise.
* If Michael is the only archangel, why does Daniel 10:13 say that he is only one of the foremost princes?
* Do you honestly think it is fair that about 2 billion children who doesn't know right from wrong will be killed at Armageddon?

You don't have to talk with them, but at least be courteous. Every courteous person who treats them well will put a tiny crack in the wall of their brainwashing. If you really want to help them, you show interest and have them come back again and again and again, and every time put another tiny crack in the wall of their brainwashing. If you are lucky you may be saving them from this exploitative cult.
