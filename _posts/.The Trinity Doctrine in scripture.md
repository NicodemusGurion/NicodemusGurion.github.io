# The Trinity, Definitions and common misunderstandings
The Christian doctrine of the Trinity is the central doctrine concerning the nature of God, which defines one God existing in three coequal, coeternal, consubstantial divine persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ) and God the Holy Spirit, three distinct persons (hypostases) sharing one essence/substance/nature (homoousion). In this context, one essence/nature defines **what** God is, while the three persons define **who** God is. Since what someone is and who someone is are two distinct concepts there is no contradiction in the idea tgat God is one essence with three persons.

## Common missundersrandings

- God is not three gods. That is called tritheism.
- God is not three personsnin one. that makes no sense.
- God is not one person manifest in three different modes, facets or aspects. That's modalism.
- God is not consisting of three parts that together form one God. That's partialism.
