How do you get an atheist really riled up? By saying that atheism is a religion. "No," protests your average atheist, "atheism is not a religion! It is the lack of belief in gods!" And that's partly true, yes. But let me explain.

Some people draw connections between things like religious books v.s. books like "On the Origin of Species" by Charles Darwin, or between priesthoods v.s. scientists like Richard Dawkins, or between prophets v.s. science informers like Neil Degrasse Tyson. But these comparisons is shallow, looking only on the external behaviors. I want to go deeper.

First of all, not all atheists are the same or have the same worldview. The only thing they have in common is a lack of belief in suoernatural beings called "gods". Fair enough. And I am sure there might be one or two atheists out there to whom this article does not apply. I mean, according to their definition, rocks and babies are atheists, so this may only apply to atheists with the capacity to think abstractly. However  this article uses the term atheist for the type of that you would typically find in online forums (and more rarely offline forums) interrupting theological discussions. And it will explain why they do so.


# Sealioning

Sealioning is the act of interrupting someone else's discussion uninvited to interject your own opinion. There is nothing wrong with this, and it is how open discussions go, especially with the relative anonymity of the Internet.

However for someone who supposedly live well and is happy in their atheism, to be so constantly and predictably sealioning online discussions with mocking and dismissive attitudes is a rather odd behavior. It's almost like they are trying to evangelize or have some ideological agenda.

And they have. 

# Worship

Atheist thinking is usually marked by a lack of depth or understanding of the underlying truths of symbolic or abstract things. So when they think of worship they think of men in robes and funny hats doing weird rituals that they don't understand. They think "That's not us! We are more enlightened!"

But worship in its essence simply means to reverence *that which is of outmost inportance*. Theists say that the creator is their Lord and God. Lord means the one who has the right to decide over your life and choices. God means the one who is the most important. (It's very rare that these two are not the same.) Theists say these titles only belong to the creator who is the ultimate reality and therefore objectively worthy of being called the most important, "God", and whose will is of paramount importance, hence "Lord".

But since an atheist does not believe in a creator, does it mean that they do not have a Lord and God? No. It just means that something or someone else bears these titles. 

# Idolatry

If you assign the titles Lord and God to anyone but the creator, you are commiting *idolatry*, meaning exchanging a part of creation for the creator.

Do atheists not have anyone whose decisions are most important? Do they not have anything they think is the most important? Of course they do. Everyone does. So atheists also have a Lord and God, but it's an idolatrous Lord and God.

# Autolatry

Some people may think that the most important in their life that gets to make the decisions could be their family, perhaps the government, a cult, an ideology, or maybe an addiction. Whatever it is, that's their Lord and God.

But the most common thing that atheists place as most important, is themselves. Some may have a completely self sacrificing attitude in thinking some external thing is the most important and the thing that determines their behavior. But usually the ultimate Lord and God in an atheistic worldview is the self. "I decide right and wrong, and my happiness is most important." 

This makes a person an autolater doing autolatry, from the Greek auto, meaning self, and latreia, meaning worship. Religious people, idolaters or not, who do not put their external God as most important, are autolaters. And most atheists are also autolaters.

So in essence, all humans with the capacity for higher thought are religious in one way or another. Atheists are religious too. Their religion is either external idolatry, or internal idolatry, autolatry.

So how do atheists perform their religion?

# Virtue signaling

Worship is to elevate and praise your deity. So if your deity is yourself, what does worship mean? Basically virtue signaling. Extolling your own excellence. Showing the world what a good person you are. 

And you see this all the time. Just visit an atheist forum like [/r/atheism on Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/atheism) or similar, and you will see page after page of comments of people proclaiming how excellent they are and how bad religious people are, and other people agreeing and affirming them. This is labeling the self as "God".

Self worship is also evident in living life in a way that benefits the self. Like how atheists affirm that morality is subjective, so that they can say that whatever they do is morally excellent if they themselves think so. This is labeling the self as "Lord".

# Virtue vampirism 

The problem with setting yourself up as Lord and God is that you're not. And you're subconsciously aware of this fact, because it is built into your very human nature that whatever you are, you're not God. You are not the most important person in existence. Your opinions do not determine right and wrong.

Since an atheistic worldview lacks a true rightful sovereign, any morality, ethics and virtue it could produce is merely subjective and therefore utterly worthless and meaningless. Atheism is a worldview that can not provide a person with a sense of being virtuous. And the human soul yearns for that sense of being virtuous and righteous, since it is part of seeking God, and seeking God is the meaning of life.

So what do you do when you yearn
