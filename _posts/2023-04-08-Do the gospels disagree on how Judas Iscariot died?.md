No. They provide supplementary details that tell us more exactly what happened.

> Matthew 27:5 And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he [Judas] departed, and he went and hanged himself.

This happened on a before a sabbath. His body would be hanging for at least 24 hours because no one would do the work of cutting down his body during the Sabbath.

> Acts 1:18,19 (Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness, and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out. 19 And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)

When you cut down a bloated corpse hanging from the neck, it is quite common that the decaying body would burst and the bowels gush out. It is called "Bowel wall hemorrhage" and is very common with victims of hanging. [A study on Bowel wall hemorrhage](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24365687/) shows that it can even be used as evidence that a death happened by hanging:

> "Bowel wall hemorrhage is recently suggested as **a characteristic sign of death by hanging**.... 138 hanging cases were studied. Bowel wall hemorrhage was confirmed by microscopic examination in 16 cases (11.6%). Our findings show that after exclusion of other conditions leading to intra-abdominal congestion, **presence of bowel wall hemorrhage**, especially in the small bowel, **can be an important sign for death by hanging** together with other previously described signs. "

These two pieces of evidence together paints a picture of the hanging of Judas that is scientifically and medically accurate.
