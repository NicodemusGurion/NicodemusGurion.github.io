In the Quran 5:116 we read:[In the Quran 5:116 we read:](https://quran.com/5/116)

> And ˹on Judgment Day˺ Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Did you ever ask the people to **worship you and your mother as gods besides Allah**?” He will answer, “Glory be to You! How could I ever say what I had no right to say? If I had said such a thing, you would have certainly known it. You know what is ˹hidden˺ within me, but I do not know what is within You. Indeed, You ˹alone˺ are the Knower of all unseen.

Mary has never been a part of the Trinity. It appears that Allah has no idea what Christians believe.
