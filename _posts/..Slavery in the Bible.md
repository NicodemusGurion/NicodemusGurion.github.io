The word slavery brings up horrible images of lives and families destroyed, people kidnapped from their homes, shipped to foreign lands, treated inhumanely, being forced to do hard labor against their will with no pay, being tortured, chained up and experiencing immense suffering. So when the topic of slavery is dealt with in the Bible, many wonder how a loving God could allow something so horrible to happen? In this article we will look at what slavery described in the Bible was really like, and see that it is not at all what many people assume. 

While the Bible describes slavery in places like Egypt, which was harsh unpaid labor and mistreatment, it does not condone or prescribe it. This article will only deal with the form of slavery that is described in the context of the Torah, which is what most critics criticise.

However the slavery as described in the Torah is not really slavery, but rather bond-servitude. So in this article such servants will be referred to as bind-servants to distinguish them from the horrific types of slavery most people think about.

# The Patron-Client relationship 

In ancient societies and many modern ones, societies were based on mutual relationships. One common form of relationship between people was the patron-client relationship. It is simply where a person who is more famous, welathy or powerful enters a mutually beneficial relationship with a person who is less successful. The powerful person, the Patron, takes on the responsibility for taking care of the less powerful person, the Client. For example providing money, food, housing or other necessities, or helping and protecting them. The Client in turn would work for the Patron doing things to increase their fame, fortune or power. It was a loosely regulated way to scratch one anothers' backs so to speak. Both parties benefitted.

This form of relationship extended from the highest echelons, with the king or emperor, down to the lowest strata of society. Everyone had mutually beneficial relationships with others on different levels of society. And that's how social security worked before modern big governments centralized it.

If you read the Bible you see these forms of relationships all over the place. And it includes servants, sometimes called slaves. For example, Abraham had a slave or servant, or client, called Eleazar. He was Abraham's most trusted ally, given very serious tasks that required a lot of trustworthiness. If Abraham would not have had a son, Eleazar would have probably inherited his wealth. And this was not a strange ocurrence. Being the slave (client) of a good master (patron) was a good job.

# Kidnapping was illegal

One reason why bond-servitude as described in the Torah is not common slavery is that according to the Torah, kidnapping was illegal.

# A bond-servant was a contractual worker

As the name suggests, the bond-servant was a contractual worker. The Torah describes how such a person would voluntarily sell himself into servitude. A common reason was if he came upon hard times and couldn't make ends meet. So a simple solution was to enter into a contract with a more well-off patron as a worker. He would work in exchange for room and board, for a limited time, was well protected by the law, and could often expect remuneration at the end of this period.

# Servitude was time-limited

According to the Torah, every 7 year was a Sabbath year. This meant many things, but among them was that bond-servants were to be set free. 

If a bond-servant was satisfied with his patron, he could voluntarily decide to stay on for the rest of his life. Then the patron would have to take care of him almost like a family member.

# A bond-servant was reimbursed for their work.

When a bond-servant left his service with his patron, the Torah commands that the patron remunerates his client by giving him enough to start his life as a freed man.

# A bond-servant could run away at any time

If a master wss mistreating his bond-servant, there was a specific law that said that if he ran away from there, no one should return him. Rather they should give him a place to live and allow him to become a part of their society. So  pravtically speaking, being a bond-servant was entirely voluntary.

# A bond-servant was treated well

The Torah was at the time the epitome of virtue when it came to treating bond-servants well. If compared to other contemporary law codes such as the code of Hamurabi, the difference is like night and day. 

The code of Hamurabi prescribes that a master could treat his slaves however he wished, even mutilating or killing them. If a slave ran away, anyone who found him had to bring him back. And if they didn't they could even be executed for not bringing back a runaway slave.

The Torah however had laws against treating your bond-servant poorly. If you abused a bond-servant so that he died, you would be executed for murder yourself. So the bond-servant had the same legal protection as a free person.
