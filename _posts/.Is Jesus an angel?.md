Some people believe that Jesus is not divine but only an angel. Specifically Michael the Archangel. 

The word angel simply means messenger, so sometimes humans act as angels, and sometimes even God is said to be an angel (The Angel of Jehovah/the Lord), because they at times are performing the function of a messenger. But in this context we mean by angel the lower created spirit creatures that usually perform such tasks of service. 

The first and second chapter of Hebrews totally obliterates the idea that Jesus is an angel. Let's have a look...

> Hebrews 1:2 but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, **through whom also he created the world**.

Jesus is the creator of the world. By world the Bible means everything that is created. (Compare John 1:3 and Colossians 1:16.) The word translated "world" includes all if the universe, both space, time, matter abd energy, as well as the created spiritual world. So Jesus is beyond time itself. The Angels are created, they are part of the created world. Jesus however is the uncreated creator of the angels. He is beyond the world, beyond any created angels.

> Hebrews 1:3a He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature,

Jesus is the **radiance of the glory of God**. God is beyond this world and therefore invisible. Radiance and glory are synonymous to light, or what is visible. The radiance and glory of God is what manifests when God enters into our world. They are manifestations of God. Hence Jesus is the manifestation of God in our world. Some people got the privilege of seeing God without dying. What they saw was Jesus. 

Jesus is also the **exact imprint** of God's nature. The word translated exact imprint is the Greek *charaktēr*, which as you can hear is related to our word character. The word is used in theatre, movies and similar for what an actor plays, trying to embody an idea into visual form. A text character is also a visual representation of a sound or idea. So Jesus being the character or exact imprint of God's very being, essence or nature means that when the very essence of God enters this world, what you see is Jesus. In short, Jesus is not an angel, but God in manifested form.

> Hebrews 1:3b and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,

Jesus **upholds the universe by the word of his power.** That means that every atom in the universe is sustained in existence only because Jesus wills it to exist. Jesus could end the entire universe witha thought. He could create a new universe with another thought. This is what it means to be almighty. So Jesus is not an angel, but he is the almighty creator and sustainer of the universe. Hebrews 1:4 having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.   Hebrews 1:5 "to which one of the angels did God ever say: “You are my son; today I have become your father”"   A rhetorical question, with the answer "no one". God has never ever said that to anyangel ever. But he said it to the son. Because the Son is not an angel. Hebrews 1:6 "[God] let all of God’s angels worship him.” All angels, every single one, worships Jesus. Jesus is not among them, Jesus is not an angel. Hebrews 1:7,8 "he says about the angels: “He makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.” 8 But about the Son, he says: “Your throne, o God, is forever and ever" God says one thing to the angels and a whole other thing to the Son. The angels are called to service. The Son is called God and rules forever. Hebrews 1:10-12 These words are about Jesus. They are quoted from Psalm 102:25-27 where they are about Jehovah. Paul is telling us that what is properly said about Jehovah is properly said about Jesus. Because Jesus IS Jehovah. Heb 1:13 "about which of the angels has he ever said: “Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet”?" Rhetorical Question. The answer is, to none of the angels. God has never given this offer to any angel ever. The Son is no angel. "That is why it is necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things we have heard, so that we never drift away" (Heb 2:1-4) This is connected to your salvation. "how will we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation?" If you do not understand and acknowledge these things, namely that Jesus is special, that he is divine and not an angel, you may lose your salvation, brother.
