These are my notes reading through the Quran Surah by Surah (chapter). As someone who have read and studied the Bible my whole life I naturally have a lot of context, and I quickly noticed that unless you already have a lot of theological knowledge, the Quran makes almost no sense. Someone without theological knowledge can pick up a Bible and at least follow along in the story, but with the Quran it is quite different.

Many verses are verbose so to save space I will use ellipsis ("...") to remove unnecessary text. If you want to read the full text, it is available at [Quran.com](https://wuran.com/)

My goal is to read through and cover all of the Quran.

# Al-Fatihah

The first book "The Opener" is short and mainly praises Allah.

## 1: 1-7

> In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful. 
> All praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds, 
> the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful, 
> Master of the Day of Recompense. 
> You ˹alone˺ we worship and You ˹alone˺ we ask for help. 
> Guide us to the straight path:
> the Path of those You have blessed—not those You are displeased with, or those who are astray.

So as A first time reader I would be confused as to who this Allah person is. All I get out of this is that he is lord of all worlds, so it seems he is some intergalactic warlord. And also he is the master of the day of recompense, which indicates he might be an accountant. In any way the author of this really lays it on thick with how awesome he is, without providing any evidence why I should accept his claims. And it also tells us that the author of this can't be Allah himself, or Allah is a ridiculously narcissistic person.

Verse 4 says Allah is the Lord of judgment day. This is a title describing Jesus. So Jesus from the Bible holds the same title as Allah from the Quran.

In verse 6 the author asks Allah to guide him in the straight path. Perhaps this is why so many Muslims are converting to Christianity, or at least apostatising from Islam.

Allah have a rather polarised view of people, either blessing or being displeased with them. You'll see this bipolar behaviour further on in the Quran.

But since the first chapter is so short, so is this comment. But the next chapter is a doozy. 286 verses. Hold on to your hijabs!
