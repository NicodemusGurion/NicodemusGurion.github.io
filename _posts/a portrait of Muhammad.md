The prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam, is a fascinating character. Over a billion people follow his teachings today. But what was he really like? The Hadiths, the stories about his life, tell us many interesting details. Let's paint a portrait of Muhammad.

# His background

## Early childhood

He was born  around 570 A.D. in Mecca. His father died when he was born, his mother when he was 6. He was taken care of by his grandfather, who also died when Muhammad was 8. 

Psychologists like John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth have studied how early attachment experiences shape a person’s emotional and relational development. Children who experience the loss of multiple caregivers may develop an “insecure attachment style” due to the instability and lack of consistent emotional support. Such trauma can lead to a range of emotional responses, including anxiety, depression, anger, or emotional numbness. 

Losing caregivers, especially if they include father figures, might lead to rebellion or defiance. Some individuals may become rebellious or defiant towards authority figures due to anger or distrust that stems from their past experiences of loss.

This ties in well with Muhammad's later behavior, for example his denial of the fatherhood of God

Muhammad would later say that both his father and mother were in hell. This is not a healthy thing to say but is probably his childhood trauma acting up. 

## Adulthood before prophethood

When he grew up, Muhammad first proposed marriage to his cousin, but his uncle thought that he was too poor so he wouldn’t allow it. Later on Muhammad eventually got to marry another one of his cousins, Zaynab bint Jahsh.

When he was 25 he started working for his third cousin once removed, Khadijah, 40, who was the owner of a caravan company. He took a caravan to Syria and impressed her so much that she proposed marriage.

Khadijah's nephew bought her a slave boy kidnapped from the Kalbi tribe, named Zayd ibn Haritha. The couple later adopted him as their own son, calling him Zayd ibn Muhammad, or Zayd the son of Muhammad.

Before  his call to prophethood, Muhammad was a pagan who sacrificed to the pagan gods. Once he had just come back from sacrificing an animal to the pagan idols, and offered some of the meat to [Zaid ibn Amr Nufayl a monotheist who lived in Mecca shortly before Islam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zayd_ibn_Amr). Zaid refused, saying he would not eat anything sacrificed to false gods.[^pagan]

[^pagan]: [Sahih al-Bukhari 5499](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5499) 


# Call to prophethood

Muhammad seem to have liked to stay away from his wife as much as possible, so he spent most of his free time in a cave called Hira, only stopping by at home to replentish his  rations. And one day when he was about 40 years old, while doing his thing in the cave, a jinn[^jinn] came and visited him.

The jinn demanded that Muhammad read. Read what? He doesn't say, so it's confusing. Muhammad, who have spent the last 15 years in idle luxury, has not bothered to learn how to read, so he tells the jinn that he can not read. The jinn didn't know this of course because it was not from God, so he keeps insisting that Muhammad must read... something. When he doesn't read, the jinn then starts manhandling poor Muhammad, throwing him around like a rag doll, pressing him so hard that he can barely breathe, and starts beating him to within an inch of his life.

Anyone with a biblical background immediately sees that this is not an angel from God. This is an evil malevolent creature. Never before has an angel of God manhandled a prophet or righteous person. People can easily be startled by a visitation from an angel, but an angel of God will always comfort the person. Never beat them to a pulp. So it's obvious to anyone who isn't theologically illiterate or lacking common sense that this is an evil malicious entity.

[^jonn]: A jinn is what we would call a demon, a spirit creature, usually of a malevolent kind. Although the Hadiths suggest that jinn can convert to Islam. [Sunan Abi Dawud 5257](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:5257)

Muhammad is so afraid that he runs home, heart pounding, shouting to his wife to hide him under a blanket. After he calms down, he consults with an uncle who is a Christian. This uncle is unfortunately theologically illiterate, and suggests that Muhammad has had a visit from a real angel and is a prophet. Soon after that the uncle dies. (May God forgive him for what his stupidity triggered.)

Muhammad is not convinced though. He keeps being harassed by this jinn on several occasions, and thinks that he is demon posessed. It gets so bad that Muhammad several times tries to commit suicide.

# His appearance

What did he look like? 

The Hadiths tell us that Muhammad was white. He was of medium height, with wavy hair and big hands. He used to dye his beard yellow. He wore eyeliner and mascara. He had a gap between his front teeth. And he liked to dress in read.

But Muhammad was also a cross dresser, who at one point was caught stealing a piece of ladies red velvet  underwear, and who regularly dressed in his favorite wife Aisha's dresses. He was convinced that Allah would only give him revelations while he was wearing her clothes.

# His hygiene

Muhammad was, you could say, a bohemian man who would probably think  "hygiene" was some kind of greeting.

Muhammad believed that water simply could not become polluted by anything. When people complained about the water quality of a well in which dead dogs and donkeys, menstrual cloths and excrement of people was thrown, he said "water is pure and is not defiled by anything".

He told his followers that after a meal, they should pick each other's hands, especially under the finger nails. [^lickfingers] And they should eat food that has been on the ground. [^groundfood].

# His character

Jesus said that we could tell a prophet by their fruit, or behavior. So what character traits did Muhammad display?

Muhammad was illiterate. Learning to read is simple and almost anyone can do if given the opportunity. Since he was very well-off, lack of opportunity was no excuse. In fact, running a caravan business it would seem like basic literacy would be a prerequisite. The only reason why he was illiterate would be because he's either extremely lazy or negligent, or that he was so mentally deficient that he simply could not pick it up.

Muhammad was abusive towards orphans. Once he met an orphan girl, and just randomly for no reason cursed her saying that she would die young. The girl was distraught of course, and when Muhammad was confronted by her legal guardian, he just shrugged it off as if it was no big deal.

In Surah 80:1,2 a blind man comes to him, and Muhammad frowns and turns away in contempt.

Muhammad also was not a patron of the arts. Rather he was a philistine who believed that it was better to fill your stomach with corroding pus than to fill your mind with poetry. 

Do you like puppies? Muhammad did not like puppies. He ordered all his followers to kill all dogs and puppies.
