Our Muslim friends often question the integrity of the Bible, but in doing so they commit kufr, denying the direct revelation of the Quran.

# What history reveals

See the article ["The Bible has been corrupted"](/The-Bible-has-been-corrupted).

In short, we have today extant complete Bibles from the 2nd-4th century A.D., and extant complete Tanakhs (Jewish Old Testament Bibles) from the 2nd-3rd century B.C. We can compare these to modern Bibles and see that for 2300 years there has been no changes what so ever.

# What the Quran says

In Surah 2:4,41,89,91,97,101;3:3-4,23,81,93,184;4:47;5:44,48,66,68;6:91-92;10:37,94;12:111;16:43;20:133;21:7,105;26:196;28:48-49;35:25,31;37:37;40:53;46:12,30;87:18-19 the Quran repeatedly confirms the authenticity, integrity, and divine origin of the Christian and Jewish scriptures that were available in Arabia in the 7th century B.C. 

- It says that the Bible is the word of Allah, and calls Jews and Christians "the people of the Book". 
- It is "confirming that which is with you", and "verifying that which you have", showing that the Bibles in the 7th century were approved by Allah. 
- It says the Quran is "confirming all previous scriptures" and that Allah sent down the Torah, Psalms, Gospels and all other scriptures. 
- It confirms that the previous messengers were all from Allah. 
- It says that the Quran is corroborating the Torah and Gospel. 
- It says that Jews and Christians should judge from the Bible, and so did Muhammad. 
- It says that Muslims should ask Jews and Christians about theological matters.

# Conclusion

The Quran says the Bible of the 7th century was uncorrupted and authoritative. Since we have archaeological evidence that it is identical with the Bible we have today, that means there are no changes, and no corruption.

A Muslim can not be a Muslim unless they believe that the Bible is the Word of Allah, that it has been perfectly preserved, and that its contents is true and reliable. Claiming that it is unreliable or corrupted is kufr.
