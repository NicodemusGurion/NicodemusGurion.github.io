The King James Version renders Genesis 3:5 as:

> Genesis 3:5 (KJV) For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be **as gods**, knowing good and evil.

The New International Version renders it as:

> Genesis 3:5 (NIV) “For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be **like God**, knowing good and evil.”

Notice the difference in bold: The NIV writes God in singular, and the KJV in plural. Most other translations write it in singular, although some, like the CSB adds the footnote <span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3); -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(222, 229, 237); text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none">"Or</span><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3); -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(222, 229, 237); text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span>_gods_<span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3); -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(222, 229, 237); text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none">, or</span><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3); -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(222, 229, 237); text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span>_divine beings_" at this point. Which one is correct? Let's have a look at [the Hebrew text analysis from Biblehub.com](https://biblehub.com/text/genesis/3-5.htm) ![](https://thyreon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/img_1179.jpg) In this table you can see the Strongs Concordance number, the Hebrew word and pronunciation, the english meaning and a code that describes the grammatical morphology. In hebrew the verb comes before the noun. Both verbs and nouns can be singular or plural, and generally the verb should match the noun. For example in, look for the verb translated "then will be opened", and you see that the grammatical code begins with a V for verb and ends with "p" for plural, which means it is a plural verb. The noun translated "your eyes" is marked with an "N" for noun and ends with a "p" for plural which means that the noun eyes are plural too. So the plural verb for "open" is used with the plural noun for "eyes". So far, so good. This is not always the case though, and there's an example in this very verse. Look at the second word, "knows". The morphology code begins with "V" and ends with "s" so its a singular verb, indicating that the agent performing it is singular. The next word, Elohim (God) has a morphology code beginning with "N" and ending in "p" meaning "God" is a plural noun. So we have here a singular verb with a plural noun. ((This is a hint that God, although a singular being, is still a plural being.)) Having a singular verb before the plural noun Elohim is how the Hebrew text indicates that Elohim means Almighty God, and not some other lesser spirit being. But when we get to the phrase "you will be like God" things are different. The morphological code of both the verb and noun end in "p" for plural. So in this case Elohim has a plural verb, indicating that it does **not** talk about God Almighty, but about other lesser gods. So the correct translation is basically what the King James Version says: "ye shall be as gods". Why do so many translations get this wrong? Probably because of bias. The idea if other lesser gods seems foreign or weird. It sounds like a pantheon. But the truth is that the biblical worldview is that there are in fact mighty spirit beings who set themselves up as gods to be worshipped. These are called Elohim as well. ((Elohim more accurately means "spirits" rather than god or gods. Even the spirit of Samuel was called an "elohim".)) And God originally set them up to rule the nations, but they became disobedient and started accepting worship themselves. This idea is weird to modern people, so when they encounter such a detail they misinterpret it. But as a rule of thumb: If you do not find the Bible to be weird, you're not reading it properly.
