[In the Quran, surah 9:30 it reads](https://quran.com/9/30):

> **The Jews say, “Ezra is the son of Allah,**” while the Christians say, “The Messiah is the son of Allah.” Such are their baseless assertions, only parroting the words of earlier disbelievers. May Allah condemn them! How can they be deluded ˹from the truth˺?

This is of course false. The Jews do not believe that. Was it Mohammed or Allah who made this error? And why is there such errors in the Quran if it is the perfect word of Allah?
