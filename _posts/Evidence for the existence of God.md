# Life comes from life

Life always comes from life, therefore it is more plausible to believe that there exist an eternal living being.

# Moral absolutes

When someone steals my stuff I tell them "You **should** not have done that!" Every time we use the word "should" you are appealing to a standard outside of us governing all of us. You're saying to someone that "You know that there is a moral standard beyond us humans and you know that it is real."

The only way that standard can exist if there is some kind prior or beyond human minds who defines that standard.

# Love

The only way love as a real intangible value can exist is if there is some type of mind to define that value.
