[In surah 4:157 we read:](https://quran.com/4/157)

> and for boasting, “We killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.” But they neither killed nor crucified him—it was only made to appear so.1 Even those who argue for this ˹crucifixion˺ are in doubt. They have no knowledge whatsoever—only making assumptions. They certainly did not kill him.

This verse soundly denies the fact that Jesus was executed by crucifixion. However [the crucifixion of Jesus is an established historical fact that no credible scholars deny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus).((The [baptism of Jesus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism_of_Jesus "Baptism of Jesus") and his crucifixion are considered to be two historically certain facts about Jesus. [James Dunn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dunn_(theologian) "James Dunn (theologian)") states that these "two facts in the life of Jesus command almost universal assent" and "rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts" that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus. [Bart Ehrman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Ehrman "Bart Ehrman") states that the crucifixion of Jesus on the orders of [Pontius Pilate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontius_Pilate "Pontius Pilate") is the most certain element about him. [John Dominic Crossan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dominic_Crossan "John Dominic Crossan") states that the crucifixion of Jesus is as certain as any historical fact can be. Eddy and Boyd state that it is now "firmly established" that there is non-Christian confirmation of the crucifixion of Jesus. [Craig Blomberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Blomberg "Craig Blomberg") states that most scholars in the third [quest for the historical Jesus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_for_the_historical_Jesus "Quest for the historical Jesus") consider the crucifixion indisputable. [Christopher M. Tuckett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_M._Tuckett "Christopher M. Tuckett") states that, although the exact reasons for the death of Jesus are hard to determine, one of the indisputable facts about him is that he was crucified. [John P. Meier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_P._Meier "John P. Meier") views the crucifixion of Jesus as historical fact and states that Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader, invoking the [criterion of embarrassment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_of_embarrassment "Criterion of embarrassment")principle in historical research. Meier states that a number of other criteria, e.g., the criterion of [multiple attestation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_attestation "Multiple attestation") (i.e., confirmation by more than one source) and the criterion of coherence (i.e., that it fits with other historical elements) help establish the crucifixion of Jesus as a historical event.)) It is also the foundation of the world's largest religion. It is also clearly described in multiple accounts in the Bible, the word of God which the Quran otherwise affirms.
