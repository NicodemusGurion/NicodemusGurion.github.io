> [2:23](https://quran.com/2/23) And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a sûrah like it and call your helpers other than Allah, if what you say is true.  [2:24](https://quran.com/2/24) But if you are unable to do so—and you will never be able to do so—then fear the Fire fuelled with people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers.

The Quran rests its claim of truthfulness and inspiration on its literary merit. It claims that it is impossible to produce a better literary work. ((Pretty much the majority of literature in history is better in every category.)) So if you can produce something better then the Quran is not from Allah.
