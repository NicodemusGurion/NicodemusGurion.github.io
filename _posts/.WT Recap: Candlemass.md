<p>According to <em>The Catholic Encyclopedia,</em>Candlemas, which falls on February 2, is a day set aside to honor the purification of the Virgin Mary. It is to recall Mary’s obeying God’s law by going to the temple in Jerusalem and offering a sacrifice of purification after she bore Jesus. (<a class="b" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101970044/0/0">Luke 2:21-24;</a><a class="b" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101970044/0/1"> Lev. 12:1-4</a>) How strange! The Catholic church teaches that Mary was sinless when she conceived Jesus, yet sets aside a day to honor her performance of an act that proves that she was not sinless but was imperfect, as are all the descendants of Adam.—<a class="b" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101970044/1/0">Rom. 3:23;</a><a class="b" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101970044/1/1"> 5:12</a>.</p>
