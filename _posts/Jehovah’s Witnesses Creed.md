We believe in one God, Jehovah, the Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and unseen. 

We believe in one Lord, Michael the Archangel, the only Son of God, created by Jehovah, a god but not the true God, the first creation of Jehovah through whom Jehovah then created all other things.
