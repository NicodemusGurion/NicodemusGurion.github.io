Both the Bible and the Quran talks about someone titled "The First and the Last". Who is it that bear this unique and significant title? 
  
In the Quran, Surah 57:3 it says about Allah:

> He is the First and the Last, the Most High and Most Near, and He has perfect knowledge of all things.

The Quran says that Allah is called "the First and the Last". The Bible agrees that God is indeed "the First and the Last."

> Isaiah 44:6 Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: “I am **the first and I am the last**; besides me there is no god.

> Isaiah 48:12 “Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called! I am he; **I am the first, and I am the last.**

And the one who is **the** first and **the** last is without doubt eternal and the creator of everything else. So I think we can all agree that if anyone is called "the First and the Last", he must be Allah, right?

Good.

Let's look at the first chapter of Revelation where John met someone appearing in a mighty manifestation, bright like fire and molten metal, his face like the sun. John is so scared that he falls to the ground.

> Revelation 1:17-18 When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, “Fear not, **I am the first and the last**, 18 and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades.

This person identifies himself as "the First and the Last", in other words this is Allah. He also calls himself "the First and the Last" in the next chapter:

> Revelation 2:8 "And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: ‘The words of **the first and the last**, who died and came to life.'"

This is Allah. No doubt. No one else can claim that title.

But did you notice? Revelation 1:18 says "I died, and behold I am alive forevermore" and 2:8 says "who died and came to life". 

When did Allah ever die and come back to life?

It happened when God came to earth, died, and was resurrected, as **Jesus**.

Yes, this is talking about Jesus. Jesus is "the First and the Last". Jesus is called by a title that **only** belongs to Allah. Because Jesus **is** Allah.

In Revelation 22:13, "the First and the Last", Jesus, is also called "the Alpha and the Omega", a synonymous title. 

> Revelation 22:13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”

And in Revelation 1:8, "the Alpha and  the Omega" is also called The Lord God Almighty.

> Revelation 1:8 “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”

Which also is the same Jesus that met John.

So the Quran shows that Jesus Christ is Allah almighty. The First and the Last.
