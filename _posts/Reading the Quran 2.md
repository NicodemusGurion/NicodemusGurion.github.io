title: Reading the Quran, Surah 1 Al-Fatihah
tags: [Islam, Quran, Reading the Quran]
---

This is the second chapter of the Quran, a massive 286 verses! Even the most massive chapter of the Bible has "only" 176 verses. And this is after reading a chapter of 7 verses. And it seems that most chapters of the Quran contains hundreds of verses. This could easily have been divided up in 5-6 chapters, which would make it much easier to digest. This is probably going to be a long article, and I suspect most articles are going to become obscenely long due to this fact. To save space I will provide a link to the verses but only quote relevant parts.

[TOC]

# Al-Baqarah

## 2: 1

> Alif-Lãm-Mĩm.

We start off strong with some cryptic letters that no one knows what they means. So much for the the Quran being "clear and easy to understand."

## [2: 2-4](https://quran.com/2/2-4)

> This is the Book! There is no doubt about it—

Who is the author trying to convince? Himself? Just saying "there's no doubt" doesn't make it so. This is a problem I see many Muslims have: They think that just saying something  means that it's true, without giving any evidence. The Quran is true because it's the word of Allah and it's the word of Allah because it says so, and we can trust what it says because it's true. 

> a guide for those mindful ˹of Allah˺, 

It spells out the purpose of the Quran: An instruction manual. Not like the Bible which contains history, wisdom, doctrine, and specific instructions to specific people, the Quran is just a general instruction manual for all times and places.

> who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and donate from what We have provided for them,

Muslims **establish prayer** and **donate**, which are works. Islam is a works based religion where you try to earn brownie points with Allah. But exactly how many points are sufficient and what your score is is unknown. Therefore a Muslim can do good works all their lives and never be assured of salvation. In Christianity, we are assured of salvation, not because of what *we* do but because of what *Jesus* did. It relieves us of the uncertainty.

> and who believe in what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ and what was revealed before you, and have sure faith in the Hereafter.

Those who believe in Muhammad should also believe in **what was revealed before** him, that is the Bible and it's prophets. The Quran tells Muslims to believe the Bible, but the Muslims tells me that the Bible has been corrupted. Whom should I trust? Allah, or the Muslims who say Allah is wrong?

## [2: 5-7](https://quran.com/2/5-7)

> It is they who are ˹truly˺ guided by their Lord, and it is they who will be successful…

The Quran often use terms like **successful** and **losers** like it was written by a 14 year old. But it emphasises the works righteousness aspect. You are counted as successful or not based on what you do.

> Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and over their sight is a veil; for for them is a great punishment.

Discussing unbelievers, it says that **Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and over their sight is a veil**, in other words they are predestined to hell, and there is no one to blame but Allah. He dun it.

This sounds like Calvinism, which I often say is the Islam of Christianity. It paints God as an evil, twisted trixter who plays games with people. 

## [2: 8-10](https://quran.com/2/8-10)

> And of mankind are those who say, “We have attained faith in Allah and in the Last Day,” but they are not believers… In their hearts is sickness, so Allah increased their sickness, and for them is a painful punishment on account of how they used to lie.

Discussing fake believers, Allah is not exactly helping them, but making their condition worse, so he can punish them. Very unloving.

## [2: 11-20](https://quran.com/2/11-20)

> …Allah took away their light and left them in darkness(es) , unable to see … Or like a cloudburst from the sky in which are darkness(es) and thunder and lightning. They put their fingers into their ears against the thunderbolts, in fear of death … The lightning almost snatches their sight(s) away; whenever it illuminates for them, they walk in it. But when it darkens over them, they stand(still).

Discussing false Muslims is says that rather than helping them, Allah is deliberately taking away their light and leaving them in darkness, terrifying them, like a cat plays with it's prey. Not very helpful, Allah!

## [2: 21-22](https://quran.com/2/21-22)

This section is boring. It just encourages people in general to worship Allah.

## 2: 23

> [And if you are in doubt about what We have bestowed upon Our servant from on high, then bring a single surah of its like, and call your witnesses apart from Allah if you are truthful.](https://quran.com/2/23)

This famous challenge is that the Quran is the word of Allah because of it's literary quality. Well, so far it has not backed up it's claim. Everything thus far has been confusing, humdrum and uninspired, jumping between random topics, with little to no explanation or context.The bit about the lightning was probably the highlight so far, but it's far from impressive.

Literary excellence is a really weird  condition for divine inspiration. I mean, in that case any half decent poet is more inspired than Allah and Muhammad.

But let's provide a Surah better than what we've seen so far. It doesn't have to rhyme, just sound pretty. And judging from [Surah 108](https://quran.com/108), 3 verses should be sufficient. So how about this:

> The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. 
> He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. 
> Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 
> You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 
> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

How did I do?

## [2: 24](https://quran.com/2/24)

> But if you do not—and you will not—then be mindful of the Fire whose fuel is people and stones; it has been prepared for the deniers.

If I'm a denier and unable to provide something more lyrical than the Quran, it threatens with hell. Luckily while I am a denier, I was able to provide a Surah that was way more excellent than any Surah in the Quran, so I think I'm safe.

Apparently hell is fueled by people? And stones? In the Bible hellfire does not need fuel. Also in the Bible hell is not prepared for humans but for the satan and the demons. Humans were not supposed to go to hell but it's just an unfortunate side effect of rejecting God. But in Islam hell is made specifically to torture humans, and as we learned, Allah is deliberately causing people to go to hell. 

## [2: 25](https://quran.com/2/25)

> And give glad tidings to those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds: that for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with any produce therefrom as provision, they say, “This is what we were provided with before,” and they are brought(them) in(perfect) resemblance. And for them are cleansed spouses therein, and therein they abide.

The promise of paradise. The carrot to the stick of hell in the previous verse. The Quran gets no points for subtlety.

Notice that the fruits you get in paradise all taste the same. To be fair, eating the same thing for eternity sounds like a hell in itself.

And of course sex. Can't forget that sex is a central point in Islam. Even in the afterlife you need spouses. While the Bible it is said that there will be no marriage or sex in heaven, in Islam, sex in paradise is a requirement.

Tell me your religion was invented by a sex crazed horn-dog without saying your religion was invented by a sex crazed horn-dog.

## [2:26](https://quran.com/2/26)

> Indeed, Allah does not shy away from setting forth any parable, ... He misguides many thereby…


It's interesting that Allah is said to be using parables, and whether someone understands them or not depends on whether they are humble or not. This is one of the attributes of Jesus, who used parables because the humble understands them but the proud does not. (Matt. 13:10-17; Mark 4:11,12; Luke 8:9, 10) One of many ayah that inadvertently admit that Jesus is Allah.

However it says that Allah misguides people, and [Allah being a liar and deceiver is going to be a recurring theme.](/quran-and-hadiths#allah-deceives)

## [2: 27](https://quran.com/2/27

> …those are the losers.)

Allah has the vocabulary of a 14 year old boy.

## 2:28

> […you were lifeless and He gave you life, then He puts you to death, then He brings you to life, then to Him you are returned](https://quran.com/2/28)

So Muslims pre-existed lifeless, then became alive, then dead, then alive again, then go to Allah? What busywork.

Is this an admission that humans will indeed be with God in the end? I thought people could never come near Allah? Sometimes you can hear faint echoes of biblical theology in the heresy.

## [2: 29](https://quran.com/2/29)

> It is He Who created for you what is on earth, all together, then turned to the heaven and formed them into seven heavens…

We learn that Allah created the earth first and then the heavens, 7 of them. In the Bible God created the heavens and the earth, and there are 3 heavens. Funny how Islam seems to invert and pervert so many things.

## [2: 30-34](https://quran.com/2/30-34)

> … your Lord said to the angels, “I am appointing a viceroy in the earth.” … We said to the angels, “Prostrate yourselves to Adam”, so they prostrated themselves—but not Iblis. He refused and acted arrogantly and became of the deniers.

Muhammad is regering to a fable taken from [the apocryphal book of the life of Adam and Eve 13.2](http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/anderson/vita/english/vita.lat.html), where Adam is assigned as the ruler of the angels and God makes the angels bow down to him, but Sayan refuses. It was written between around 100 BC-100 AD and it's an example of one of many false stories that Muhammad have just heard, thought was real, and included in the Quran. Either that or "Allah" can't tell fact from fan fiction.

> …He taught Adam the names, all of them…

In verse 31 it says that Allah **taught Adam the names**. Assuming this means the names of the animals, this disagrees with the Bible. Adam was the one who got to give names to the animals. God in the Bible allows his creatures to exercise creativity, but Allah from the Quran is not as magnanimous.



## [2: 35-39](https://quran.com/2/35-39)

> Yet Satan made them slip therefrom, so he brought them out of what they were in. Then We said, “Descend , as enemies to one another, for in the earth you have a place of settlement and enjoyment for a while.”

This verse is fuzzy but it appears that after the fall, Adam and Eve "descended" from Eden, as if it was not part of earth.

## [2: 40-46](https://quran.com/2/40-46)

> O Children of Israel

This book is jumping all over the place. Now it adresses Jews.

Fun fact: The Quran mentions Israel a lot,  but never mentions any Palestinians...

> And believe in what I have sent down, confirming what is with you

Allah tells Jews to believe the Quran because it confirms **what is with you**, that is, the Torah. This means that at the time the Quran was written, the Jews had a Torah that Allah said to be uncorrupted. 

However we have extant Torahs that are 800 years older than this, and they are identical with today's texts, and all of these do not match up with the Quran.

So either Allah wrote this and he was lying. Or Muhammad wrote this and he was ignorant and stupid.

## [2: 47](https://quran.com/2/47)

> Children of Israel, remember how I blessed you and favoured you over other people.

Allah prefers the Jews, which is weird considering [how poorly Islam treats them.](/quran-and-Hadiths/#jews)

## [2: 48](https://quran.com/2/48)

> Guard yourselves against a Day when no soul will stand in place of another, no intercession will be accepted for it, nor any ransom; nor will they be helped.

This contradicts other sources which say that on judgment day, [Muslims will be ransomed by Jews and Christians taking their place in hell.](/quran-and-Hadiths/#ransomed-from-hell).

## [2: 49-50](https://quran.com/2/49-50)

This section is about Israel in Egypt. It says that the genocide of male babies **was a great trial from your Lord**. This is false, it was from Satan. It was against God's will.

## [2: 51-56](https://quran.com/2/51-56)

This passage is about the worship of the golden calf.

> Remember when you said, ‘Moses, we will not believe you until we see God face to face.’ At that, thunderbolts struck you as you looked on. Then We revived you after your death, so that you might be thankful.

This is false. The Israelites were rather terrified and did **not** want to see God. God did **not** kill and revive them. This idea probably comes from later Jewish fables.

## [2: 58-59](https://quran.com/2/58-59)

> Remember when We said, ‘Enter this town and eat freely there as you will, but enter its gate humbly and say, “Relieve us!” Then We shall forgive you your sins and increase the rewards of those who do good.’ But the wrongdoers substituted a different word from the one they had been given. So, because they persistently disobeyed, We sent a plague down from the heavens upon the wrongdoers.

I have no idea where this comes from.  It doesn't seem to match any story of the Bible. It seems to be made up.

## [2: 60](https://quran.com/2/60)

This verse says that when Moses struck the rock **Twelve springs gushed out, and each group knew its drinking place.** This is inaccurate.  There is no mention of 12 streams.

## [2: 62](https://quran.com/2/62)

> The [Muslim] believers, the Jews, the Christians, and the Sabians- all those who believe in God and the Last Day and do good- will have their rewards with their Lord.

Once again it jumps to a wildly different topic.

**The Sabians** were a Gnostic group following John the Baptist. This list of approved groups is very random and misleading. 

## [2: 63,64](https://quran.com/2/63-64)

This passage is very vague. I have no idea what story it refers to.

## [2: 65,66](https://quran.com/2/65-66)

> You know about those of you who broke the Sabbath, and so We said to them, ‘Be like apes! Be outcasts!’

This also never happened. God has never said sabbath breakers are apes. Breaking the sabbath was punished by death, not ostracism.

## [2: 67-73](https://quran.com/2/67-73)

Some shenanigans about a cow. Also a story not mentioned in the Bible.

> Moses said to his people, ‘God commands you to sacrifice a cow.’ They said, ‘Are you making fun of us?

Why would they react like this to such a common idea as sacrificing a cow? They are baffled and don't know what is going on, asking **show us what sort of cow it should be** and Moses explains it should be **neither too old nor too young** and **bright yellow**, which is a weird color for a cow. They are still confused thinking **all cows are more or less alike to us**. So Moses needs to expand lain that it should be **perfect and unblemished cow, not trained to till the earth or water the fields**. And then finally they understand.

The cow is then apparently used to resurrect dead people by striking their dead body with a piece of the cow.

This whole story is non-existent in the Bible, very odd and pointless.

## [2: 75-78](https://quran.com/2/75-78)

> So can you believers hope that such people (Jews) will believe you, when some of them used to hear the words of God and then deliberately twist them, even when they understood them? … Some of them are uneducated, and know the Scripture only through wish-ful thinking. They rely on guesswork.

It's ironic that after [having claimed that the Torah is unchanged](#2-40-46), the author just spews a bunch of incorrect or completely fabricated stories, and then accuse Jews of twisting the words of God. Olympic levels of mental gymnastics.

## [2: 79](https://quran.com/2/79)

> So woe to those who write something down with their own hands and then claim, ‘This is from God,’ in order to make some small gain. Woe to them for what their hands have written! Woe to them for all that they have earned!

This must be the most ironic part of the Quran thus far, since Muhammad is the perfect example of **who write something down with their own hands and then claim, ‘This is from God,’ in order to make some small gain.**

Woe to him.

## [2: 80-82](https://quran.com/2/80-82)

> those who believe and do good deeds will be the inhabitants of the Garden

Islam is a works-righteousness religion. You have to do stuff to earn points to maybe go to paradise. But nowhere does it explain how many points you need or anything like that. And that means that there are a lot of really bad people in paradise, who are like 51% good and 49% evil.

## [2: 83-86](https://quran.com/2/82-86)

This passage is just general criticism against people being sinful.

## [2: 87](https://quran.com/2/87)

> We gave Moses the Scripture and We sent messengers after him in succession. We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear signs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit

Moses is mentioned 136 times. Jesus 25 times. Mary is the only woman named in the Quran 34 times. But Muhammad is only mentioned 4 times.

## [2: 88-91](https://quran.com/2/88-91)

> And when there comes to them a Book from Allah, **confirming what is with them**… When it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah Hath sent down, "they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us:" yet they reject all besides, even if it be Truth **confirming what is with them**…

This says that the Quran is **confirming what is with them**, meaning the Bible that the Jews and Christians had in the 7th century. [We have extant copies that are even 300](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Sinaiticus)-[900 years older than the Quran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls), and these are identical to modern Bibles. These are the ones the Quran claims to "confirm", so according to the Quran, the Bible has not been corrupted.

However while the Quran confirms that the Bible has not been corrupted, it also contradicts the Bible on many important points. 

So what gives? If Allah is the author of both, and the Quran affirms both, then either Allah lied in the Bible or Allah lies in the Quran. 

Or, the Quran is not written by Allah, but is written by an ignorant illiterate Arabic warlord pretending to be a inspired by God [for fun and profit.](/quran-and-Hadiths/#child-sexual-abuse)

## [2: 92-96](https://quran.com/2/92-96)

More complaints about people being disobedient.

## [2: 97-98](https://quran.com/2/97-98)

> Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel-for he brings down the (revelation) to thy heart by Allah's will, a confirmation of what went before

Islam seems to accredit Gabriel for conveying all revelation. In the Bible Gabriel is mentioned twice bringing messages. Other times it is unnamed angels, or the Word of God, or the Spirit of God who comes directly. Islam seems to conflate all these diverse means of communication God uses into one angel who is really busy.

This verse also affirms that the Bible is correct, saying the Quran is **a confirmation of what went before**, i.e. the Bible.

## [2: 99](https://quran.com/2/99)

> We have sent down to thee Manifest Signs (ayat)

Just a note on translation itself: The Arabic says "ayat" meaning verse, but it is here translated as "Signs", which is also a synonym for miracles. I just want to bring your attention to the fact that Muslims consider the Quran itself a miracle (as if writing a really poor piece of literature is beyond human ability), so each piece of text is a "miracle" because they think Allah himself authored it. It's a really strange view, but it is good to keep in mind when Muslims talk about "miracles" that their definition could potentially be vastly different from what would normally be considered a miracle. A Christian would not consider a random Bible verse to be a miracle. Perhaps if the verse was a prophecy that was fulfilled, then the prophecy would be considered a miracle, but not the text of the verse itself. Just something I have noticed.


## [2: 100-101](https://quran.com/2/100-101)

> there came to them a messenger from Allah, confirming what was with them

More complaints against faithful people and more confirmation that the Bible is not corrupted.

## [2: 102-103](https://quran.com/2/102-103)


> They followed what the evil ones gave out (falsely) against the power of Solomon: the blasphemers Were, not Solomon, but the evil ones, teaching men Magic, and such things as came down at babylon to the angels Harut and Marut.…

The names Hārūt and Mārūt do not originate from Semitic beliefs, but appear to be etymologically related to Haurvatat and Ameretat, two Amesha Spenta (a class of seven divine entities emanating from Ahura Mazda) from Zoroastrianism.

The idea that Solomon was doing magic may come from sources such as [the Testament of Solomon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testament_of_Solomon), which was written sometime between the first and tenth century A.D. It is not biblical though.

These show that Muhammad just copy-pasted random lore and fables floating around at the time.

## [2: 102-103](https://quran.com/2/102-103)

> Say not (to the Messenger) words of ambiguous import, but words of respect

The word translated "words of ambiguous import" in Arabic is Raina (رَٰعِنَا) and the word translated "words of respect" is Unzurna (ٱنظُرْنَا). "Do not say Raina but say Unzurna." 

After consulting [this Quranic dictionary](https://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp) it seems Raina means "Observe" and Unzurna means "Look". So, "don't say 'observe' but say 'look'…"

It seems the translation is taking liberties because the Arabic makes no sense whatsoever. So much for a clear and understandable message from God…
