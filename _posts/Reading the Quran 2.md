title: Reading the Quran, Surah 1 Al-Fatihah
tags [Islam, Quran, Reading the Quran]
---

This is the second chapter of the Quran, a massive 286 verses! Even the most massive chapter of the Bible has "only" 176 verses. And this is after reading a chapter of 7 verses. And it seems that most chapters of the Quran contains hundreds of verses. This could easily have been divided up in 5-6 chapters, which would make it much easier to digest. This is probably going to be a long article, and I suspect most articles are going to become obscenely long due to this fact. To save space I will provide a link to the verses but only quote relevant parts.

# Al-Baqarah

## 2: 1

> Alif-Lãm-Mĩm.

We start off strong with some cryptic letters that no one knows what they means. So much for the the Quran being "clear and easy to understand."

## 2: 2-4

> This is the Book! There is no doubt about it—a guide for those mindful ˹of Allah˺, 
> who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and donate from what We have provided for them,
> and who believe in what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ and what was revealed before you, and have sure faith in the Hereafter.

Who is the author trying to convince? Himself? Just saying "there's no doubt" doesn't make it so. This is a problem I see many Muslims have: They think that just saying something  means that it's true, without giving any evidence. 

It spells out the purpose of the Quran: An instruction manual. Not like the Bible which contains history, wisdom, doctrine, and specific instructions to specific people, the Quran is just a general instruction manual for all times and places.

Muslims **establish prayer** and **donate**, which are works. Islam is a works based religion where you try to earn brownie points with Allah. But exactly how many points are sufficient and what your score is is unknown. Therefore a Muslim can do good works all their lives and never be assured of salvation. In Christianity, we are assured of salvation, not because of what *we* do but because of what *Jesus* did. It relieves us of the uncertainty.

Those who believe in Muhammad should also believe in **what was revealed before** him, that is the Bible and it's prophets. The Quran tells Muslims to believe the Bible, but the Muslims tells me that the Bible has been corrupted. Whom should I trust? Allah, or the Muslims who say Allah is wrong?

## 2: 5-7

> [It is they who are ˹truly˺ guided by their Lord, and it is they who will be successful…](https://quran.com/2/5-7)

The Quran often use terms like **successful** and **losers** like it was written by a 14 year old. But it emphasises the works righteousness aspect. You are counted as successful or not based on what you do.

Discussing unbelievers, it says that **Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and over their sight is a veil**, in other words they are predestined to hell, and there is no one to blame but Allah. He dun it.

This sounds like Calvinism, which I often say is the Islam of Christianity. It paints God as an evil, twisted trixter who plays games with people. 

## 2: 8-10

> [And of mankind are those who say, “We have attained faith in Allah and in the Last Day,” but they are not believers… In their hearts is sickness, so Allah increased their sickness, and for them is a painful punishment on account of how they used to lie.](https://quran.com/2/8-10)

Discussing fake believers, Allah is not exactly helping them, but making their condition worse, so he can punish them. Very unloving.

## 2: 11-20

> […Allah took away their light and left them in darkness(es) , unable to see … Or like a cloudburst from the sky in which are darkness(es) and thunder and lightning. They put their fingers into their ears against the thunderbolts, in fear of death … The lightning almost snatches their sight(s) away; whenever it illuminates for them, they walk in it. But when it darkens over them, they stand(still).](https://quran.com/2/11-20)

Discussing false Muslims is says that rather than helping them, Allah is deliberately taking away their light and leaving them in darkness, terrifying them, like a cat plays with it's prey. Not very helpful, Allah!

## 2: 21-22

[It encourages people in general to worship Allah.](https://quran.com/2/21-22)

## 2: 23

> [And if you are in doubt about what We have bestowed upon Our servant from on high, then bring a single surah of its like, and call your witnesses apart from Allah if you are truthful.](https://quran.com/2/23)

This famous challenge is that the Quran is the word of Allah because of it's literary quality. Well, so far it has not backed up it's claim. Everything thus far has been confusing, humdrum and uninspired, jumping between random topics, with little to no explanation or context.The bit about the lightning was probably the highlight so far, but it's far from impressive.

Literary excellence is a really weird  condition for divine inspiration. I mean, in that case any half decent poet is more inspired than Allah and Muhammad.

But let's provide a Surah better than what we've seen so far. It doesn't have to rhyme, just sound pretty. And judging from [Surah 108](https://quran.com/108), 3 verses should be sufficient. So how about this:

> The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. 
> He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. 
> Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 
> You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 
> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

How did I do?

## 2: 24

> [But if you do not—and you will not—then be mindful of the Fire whose fuel is people and stones; it has been prepared for the deniers.](https://quran.com/2/24)

If I'm a denier and unable to provide something more lyrical than the Quran, it threatens with hell. Luckily while I am a denier, I was able to provide a Surah that was way more excellent than any Surah in the Quran, so I think I'm safe.

Apparently hell is fueled by people? And stones? In the Bible hellfire does not need fuel. Also in the Bible hell is not prepared for humans but for the satan and the demons. Humans were not supposed to go to hell but it's just an unfortunate side effect of rejecting God. But in Islam hell is made specifically to torture humans, and as we learned, Allah is deliberately causing people to go to hell. 

## 2: 25

> [And give glad tidings to those who have attained faith and have done righteous deeds: that for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with any produce therefrom as provision, they say, “This is what we were provided with before,” and they are brought(them) in(perfect) resemblance. And for them are cleansed spouses therein, and therein they abide.](https://quran.com/2/25)

The promise of paradise. The carrot to the stick of hell in the previous verse. The Quran gets no points for subtlety.

Notice that the fruits you get in paradise all taste the same. To be fair, eating the same thing for eternity sounds like a hell in itself.

And of course sex. Can't forget that sex is the central point in Islam. Even in the afterlife you need spouses. While the Bible it is said that there will be no marriage or sex in heaven, in Islam, sex in paradise is a requirement.

Tell me your religion was invented by a sex crazed horn-dog without saying your religion was invented by a sex crazed horn-dog.

## 2:26

> [Indeed, Allah does not shy away from setting forth any parable, ... He misguides many thereby and He guides many thereby, but He does not misguide thereby except the defiantly disobedient](https://quran.com/2/26)


It's interesting that Allah is said to be using parables, and whether someone understands them or not depends on whether they are humble or not. This is one of the attributes of Jesus, who used parables because the humble understands them but the proud does not. (Matt. 13:10-17; Mark 4:11,12; Luke 8:9, 10) One of many ayah that inadvertently admit that Jesus is Allah.

However it says that Allah misguides people, and [Allah being a liar and deceiver is going to be a recurring theme.](/quran-and-hadiths#allah-deceives)

## 2: 27

> […those are the losers.](https://quran.com/2/27)

Allah has the vocabulary of a 14 year old boy.

## 2:28

> […you were lifeless and He gave you life, then He puts you to death, then He brings you to life, then to Him you are returned](https://quran.com/2/28)

So Muslims existed lifeless, then alive, then dead, then alive again, then with Allah? Such busywork.

Is this an admission that humans will indeed be with God in the end? I thought people could never come near Allah? Sometimes you can hear faint echoes of biblical theology in the heresy.

## 2: 29

> [It is He Who created for you what is on earth, all together, then turned to the heaven and formed them into seven heavens...](https://quran.com/2/29)

We learn that Allah created the earth first and then the heavens, 7 of them. In the Bible God created the heavens and the earth, and there are 3 heavens. Funny how Islam seems to invert and pervert so many things.

## 2: 30-34

> [… your Lord said to the angels, “I am appointing a viceroy in the earth.” … We said to the angels, “Prostrate yourselves to Adam”, so they prostrated themselves—but not Iblis. He refused and acted arrogantly and became of the deniers.](https://quran.com/2/30-34)

Muhammad is regering to a fable taken from [the apocryphal book of the life of Adam and Eve 13.2](http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/anderson/vita/english/vita.lat.html), where Adam is assigned as the ruler of the angels and God makes the angels bow down to him, but Sayan refuses. It was written between around 100 BC-100 AD and it's an example of one of many false stories that Muhammad have just heard, thought was real, and included in the Quran. Either that or "Allah" can't tell fact from fan fiction.

> …He taught Adam the names, all of them…

In verse 31 it says that Allah **taught Adam the names**. Assuming this means the names of the animals, this disagrees with the Bible. Adam was the one who got to give names to the animals. God in the Bible allows his creatures to exercise creativity, but Allah from the Quran is not as magnanimous.



## 2: 35-39



> Yet Satan made them slip therefrom, so he brought them out of what they were in. Then We said, “Descend , as enemies to one another, for in the earth you have a place of settlement and enjoyment for a while.”

This verse is fuzzy but it appears that after the fall, Adam and Eve "descended" from Eden, as if it was not part of earth.
