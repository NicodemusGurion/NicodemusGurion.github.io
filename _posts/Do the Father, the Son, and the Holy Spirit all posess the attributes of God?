The trinity doctrine teaches that there is only one God, and that God exists as three persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Each person fully share the nature of God. This means they <em>all</em> posess <em>all</em> the attributes needed to be God.

The most prominent and unique attributes are omnipresence, omnipotence, omniscience, holiness, eternity, and truth.

Is there biblical evidence that the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit all posess these attributes?
