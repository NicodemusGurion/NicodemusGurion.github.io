# Motivation

I grew up as one of Jehovah's witnesses, being raised to unquestioningly accept their teachings as the Truth. 

As an adult, looking into their teaching and history, I saw that little of it made any sense at all and most of it was unscriptural human traditions. 

Physically: It is abusive, sometimes physically, but mostly mentally and especially spiritually.
Unenlightened attitudes and policies have made it a haven for child abuse. People die because of the unscriptural no-blood policy.

Mentally: Unscriptural teachings means they place heavy, stressful burdens on people to perform at a level that people should not be required, or else potentially lose their salvation.

Spiritually: Some of their most serious doctrines are ones that actually endanger the eternal salvation of their members, such as trusting in their organization for salvation rather than in Jesus, to not partake of Jesus flesh and blood, and that they are not anointed. These are spiritually abusive because it denies people their God-given inheritance from God and even threatens their eternal salvation.
