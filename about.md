# My story and motivation

I grew up as one of Jehovah's witnesses, being raised to unquestioningly accept their teachings as the Truth. 
It all seemed to make sense. There was an answer for everything. Although sometimes the answers were long winded and complicated, so that you kind of stopped thinking halfway through and just accepted the conclusion. 
And there were a lot of explaining away what the Bible said. Every problematic scripture had an explanation that kind of made sense. 
But since apparently "Christendom" had had its dirty fingers in everything for a long time any inconsistency could be blamed on them tampering with the Bible. 
They apparently removed God's name, and changed scriptures to support their *unscriptural* trinity and hell doctrines.
But we alone had the truth! We, a group consisting of one permille of the earths population, were the only ones who knew about these truths.
And we were the only ones teaching them.
And when Jehovah or maybe Jesus (or someone) comes back for the second or third time (or something), he will ruthlessly murder 99.9% of the worlds population, babies and good people too, for getting these irrelevant details wrong.
This will happen soon. Soonish. It will happen soon, with within the next 10 to 140 years or so. We don't know. Only God knows. But the that didnt stop the Watchtower to predict it 8 times and fail. 
So don't you dare take advantage of anything good that this life could bring because then Jehovah (or Jesus) will ruthlessly murder you too for being such an unspiritual apostate!

When you are never exposed to anything else, these things make sense. And the little exposure to other ideas I had never made an impact because the people who tried to break through the brainwashing were not very knowledgeable. Armed with all manner of tactics to defeat their arguments I had a feeling of superiority which vindicated my position.

But since I am a curious person and I want to learn more about God, I started to study more and more.
