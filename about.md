I am just a nobody trying to serve Jesus by sharing what he has taught me. I grew up in a heretical cult, but by grace Jesus freed me from their brainwashing and have blessed me with talents that I aim to use to honor him and expose the manipulation and false teachings of heretical cults. I will remain anonymous for my own safety, because heretical cult members tend to be unhinged and sometimes violent. 

On this site I will collect and curate information in as digestible and transparent manner as possible. Use the search feature to find what you're looking for. I will do my outmost to cite my sources, although I reserve the right to make my own subjective comments and conclusions based on the data. I am nobody, so I ask that you judge the content of this site based on its own merit, and not based on my authority.
